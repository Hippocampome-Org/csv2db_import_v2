A, B, Camera lucida drawing of CR-containing inhibitory interneurons from the CA1 area (2-3 in A) and the dentate gyrus (1 in B). Cell bodies and dendrites are drawn in black; axons are drawn in red. The cells were reconstructed from six consecutive, 80-[micro]m-thick sections. A characteristic property of these cells is that they often form dendro-dendritic and axo-dendritic contacts with each other. Contacting dendrites are shown in the drawings by dotted outlines. Multiple or single arrowheads indicate points where the dendrites ran parallel in close contact, or just touched each other once. An average cell forms dendro-dendritic contact with the dendritic tree of three to seven other CR-IR neurons. Axo-dendritic contacts on cells 1-4 are labeled with arrows. The number of contacts from different CR-IR axons varies between 2 and 10. In many cases, the same axon forms two or more contacts on the same dendrite. The axon of cell 3 formed multiple contacts (3 and 4, open arrows) on the CR-IR dendrite labeled 5. Note that the same two cells formed dendro-dendritic contacts as well. The axon of cell 2 formed a perisomatic basket around a CR-negative cell body in stratum radiatum (open arrows).
