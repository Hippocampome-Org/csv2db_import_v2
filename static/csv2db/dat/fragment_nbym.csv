In the dorsal hippocampus only one out of seven CA3c/zone 3 cells had axons that penetrated through the granule cell layer and terminated in the inner third of the molecular layer.

30380,1007168,"Evidence for subicular inputs to CA1 has appeared in several previous anatomical studies. Berger et al. [5] [1980] examined the anterograde and retrograde transport of HRP [horseradish peroxidase] in rabbit brains. They found that injections into the CA1 cell layer (including the proximal apical and basal dendrites) resulted in anterograde (CA1 to subiculum) label and retrograde (subiculum to CA1) label in subiculum. Injections of tritiated proline or leucine into subiculum showed anterograde label in CA1 stratum oriens (much of this interpreted as fibers headed for the alveus/fimbria) and label in CA1 stratum moleculare (ended at CA2). Finch et al. [8] [1983] traced the dendrites and axons of intracellularly labeled subicular neurons in rat brains. They reported on 12 labeled subicular neurons. Of this group of 12 labeled neurons, four projected only rostrally into the fimbria and three others had both rostrally and caudally directed projections. One of these cells {SUB SUB CA1-Projecting Pyramidal} had collaterals in subiculum with an identified collateral reaching stratum oriens of CA1. Kohler [14] [1985] used extracellular phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) injections into subiculum to trace the region's outputs. Although not discussed at length in the paper, labeled fibers are apparent in CA1 strata oriens and moleculare. It was suggested that at least some of the fibers seen in stratum oriens were actually headed for the alveus rather than directed at CA1. It was also suggested that the projections to stratum moleculare may be directed at distal apical interneurons rather than pyramidal cell dendrites. On the basis of our morphological data and attempts to block propagation by disrupting laminar paths, we conclude that the subicular fibers forming the back projection are present in the apical dendritic region and in the vicinity of the cell layer. We have visualized axons with light microscopic evidence of contacts in stratum radiatum reaching to its border with stratum lacunosum/moleculare, and axons in the cell layer. Our evidence that at least a fraction of these contacts are onto pyramidal neurons comes from the electrophysiological evidence that they mediate the spread of epileptiform events.","p48, left top",11259758,0,data,NULL,synpro_figure,5005,4000,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

This can be largely explained by the proposed same proximal dendritic synapse location (Fig. 3A). Moreover, precision in GABA release defined as the CV of synaptic latency was comparably low (HICAPÃÂBC: 0.46 ÃÂ± 0.07 vs HICAPÃÂHICAP: 0.43 ÃÂ± 0.08, p = 0.874; Figs. 2A and 6B).",p8203 right middle,24920624,0,data,NULL,synpro_figure,1009,4078,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

One explanation for this discrepancy is very likely to be the distal location of HIPP-mediated contacts at postsynaptic apical BC dendrites, which will cause longer delays in action potential conduction in contrast to the proposed proximal contacts among interconnected HIPP cells (Fig. 3B).

30505,2000038,"Some of the first physiological evidence that CA3 axons innervated the dentate gyrus came from studies in hippocampal slices, which showed that a stimulating electrode placed in the hilus could activate an antidromic population spike, recorded extracellularly in the CA3 pyramidal cell layer.Subsequent studies identified what cell types in the dentate gyrus could be influenced by the CA3 projection. Several approaches established that hilar neurons could be activated readily, but granule cells could not. First, fimbria stimulation was used to activate CA3 pyramidal cells instead of the hilus, because antidromic action potentials are easily elicited in CA3 neurons by stimulation at this site, with no evidence for direct activation of hilar neurons and granule cells. Direct activation would be expected because hilar cells that project commissurally have an axon that descends into stratum oriens of CA3b, presumably on its way to the fimbria, but in our slices, we have found that it is severed before reaching the fimbria. Direct activation of granule cells would only be possible if current spread entered stratum lucidum, which recordings show does not occur after fimbria stimulation using the methods we have employed. Extracellular recordings showed that such fimbria stimulation led to antidromic and orthodromic activation of CA3 b and c pyramidal cells, followed by an extracellular negative wave in the granule cell layer and inner molecular layer that reversed polarity in the middle molecular layer (Fig. 2). Due to the negative resting potential of granule cells, the negative potential could reflect an EPSP or depolarized IPSP, and it was shown subsequently by intracellular recording that it was a depolarized GABAA receptor-mediated IPSP (Fig. 3; Scharfman, 1994a, Scharfman, 1994b and Scharfman, 1994c). This fimbria stimulation site activated hilar mossy cells and hilar GABAergic neurons disynaptically, and was sensitive to the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX but not the muscarinic antagonist atropine (Scharfman, 1993a). At a longer latency, the granule cell IPSP began. These data suggesting that fimbria activation of CA3 pyramidal cells led to hilar neuron activation, presumably by hilar collaterals of CA3 pyramidal cells. Comparing the latency to the response of CA3 pyramidal cells and hilar cells supported this hypothesis, because CA3 pyramidal cells were activated at short latency and hilar cells approximately 2 ms later. The same stimulus evoked a long latency IPSP in granule cells, consistent with a CA3-hilar neuron-granule cell pathway. In the presence of bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist, fimbria stimulation evoked EPSPs in granule cells, and did so with a similar latency as the IPSPs, suggesting a CA3-mossy cell-granule cell pathway is normally masked by the activation of GABAergic interneurons by CA3 hilar collaterals (Fig. 3).

Therefore, the CA3c population of ventral hippocampus appears to be a subset of CA3 pyramidal cells with the highest potential for dentate gyrus interactions.

However, one caveat was that the sample sizes were small, and it remains unclear exactly how representative the data were of the entire CA3 population.

There was a relatively high probability of finding a recurrent connection between pairs of pyramidal neurons in both layer V (around 12%) and layer III (around 9%). In complete contrast, we have failed to find any recurrent synaptic connections between principal neurons in layer II, and this may be an important factor in the relative resistance of this layer in generating synchronized epileptiform activity. In general, recurrent excitatory postsynaptic potentials in layers III and V of the entorhinal cortex had similar properties to those recorded in other cortical areas, although the probabilities of connection are among the highest reported. Recurrent excitatory postsynaptic potentials recorded in layer V were smaller with faster rise times than those recorded in layer III. In both layers, the recurrent potentials were mediated by glutamate primarily acting at _-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole receptors, although there appeared to be a slow component mediated by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. In layer III, recurrent transmission failed on about 30% of presynaptic action potentials evoked at 0.2 Hz. This failure rate increased markedly with increasing (2, 3 Hz) frequency of activation. In layer V the failure rate at low frequency was less (19%), and although it increased at higher frequencies this effect was less pronounced than in layer III.

In a study of pyramidal to pyramidal cell pairs within the CA1 (Deuchars and Thomson, 1996), a pyramidal to pyramidal connection comprising two synapses was found. However, its EPSP amplitude was over twice the average amplitude of the other recorded pairs, so we assumed it was an exception.

The axon of the pyramidal cell formed 15 295 boutons, 63.8% of which were in stratum oriens, 15.4% in stratum pyramidale and 20.8% in stratum radiatum. Only 2.1% of the axon terminals contacted parvalbumin-positive neurons. Most of these were single contacts (84.7%), but double or triple contacts (15.3%) were also found. The majority of the boutons terminated on dendrites (84.1%) of parvalbumin-positive cells, less frequently on cell bodies (15.9%). In order to estimate the proportion of contacts representing synapses, 16 light microscopically identified contacts between boutons of the filled pyramidal cell axon and the parvalbumin-positive targets were examined by correlated electron microscopy. Thirteen of them were found to be asymmetrical synapses, and in the remaining three cases synapses between the labelled profiles could not be confirmed.

Autocorrelation of the trace before (b) and during (c) regular basket cell activity shows an increased rhythmicity of pyramidal cell firing during periodic activation of the interneuron. C, a, Effect of periodic rhythmic discharge of a single basket cell on sub-threshold membrane potential oscillations in a pyramidal cell. Dotted lines indicate intervals of 0.26 s. Autocorrelograms of the trace before (b) and following (c) entrainment show an increased rhythmicity during periodic activation of the interneuron. METHODS. Dual intracellular recordings were made from synaptically coupled CA1 interneuron to pyramidal cell pairs from 400-).lm-thick transverse adult rat hippocampal slices as described 8. Slices were maintained at the interface between artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing (in mM): 126 NaCI, 3 KCI, 1.25 NaH 2 P0 4 , 24 NaHC0 3 , 2 MgS0 4, 2 CaCI 2 , 10 glucose, pH 7.2, and a humidified atmosphere of 95% 0 2 and 5% C0 2 , at 34-35 ÃÂ¡C. Sharp glass microelectrodes contained 2% biocytin in 1.5 M potassium methylsulphate and were bevelled to a d.c. resistance of 60-150 MQ. Recovered biocytin-labelled cells were analysed in the light microscope and target selectivity was determined by electron microscopy for a total of 94 basket cell and 22 axo-axonic cell synaptic contacts, ranging from 6 to 24 contacts per cell. All values are expressed as means ÃÂ± s.d. The number of synaptically coupled pairs exceeds the number of interneurons because the latter could serve as the presynaptic partner for more than one recorded pyramidal cell.",p76,7477292,0,data,NULL,synpro_figure,4078,4000,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

The characteristic feature of these neurons is their axonal projection terminating in the outer molecular layer in a particular vertically oriented fashion (Fig. 8B). The main axon emerges from either the soma or one of the primary dendrites (Fig. 8B). Shortly after leaving the soma, the axon gives off several very long axonal collaterals ( <% 900 [micro]m) [less than or equal to 900 microm]. One population then takes a more or less vertical course passing through the granule cell layer, the inner molecular layer, and finally terminating within the outer molecular layer.

In both rats and primates they formed numerous asymmetric synapses with large boutons of mossy fibers. Peripheral dendrites were covered with small, simple spines. Interestingly, these peripheral dendrites lacking excrescences also established asymmetric synapses with mossy fiber boutons as well as asymmetric and symmetric contacts with smaller terminals of unknown origin. These findings indicate that in both rats and primates the thorny excrescences are not the only target of the mossy terminals.

The axon of the pyramidal cell formed 15 295 boutons, 63.8% of which were in stratum oriens, 15.4% in stratum pyramidale and 20.8% in stratum radiatum. Only 2.1% of the axon terminals contacted parvalbumin-positive neurons. Most of these were single contacts (84.7%), but double or triple contacts (15.3%) were also found. The majority of the boutons terminated on dendrites (84.1%) of parvalbumin-positive cells, less frequently on cell bodies (15.9%). In order to estimate the proportion of contacts representing synapses, 16 light microscopically identified contacts between boutons of the filled pyramidal cell axon and the parvalbumin-positive targets were examined by correlated electron microscopy. Thirteen of them were found to be asymmetrical synapses, and in the remaining three cases synapses between the labelled profiles could not be confirmed. We conclude that the physiologically effective excitatory connections between single pyramidal cells and postsynaptic inhibitory neurons are mediated by a small number of contacts, mostly by a single synapse.

A representative example of an aspiny hilar interneuron with an axonal projection to the outer molecular layer is given in Fig. 8B. These neurons (n Ã¯Â¿Â½=4) usually had somata located within the deep hilus, 20-50 [micro]m beneath the granule cell layer, and were fusiform in shape, with two- to four thick smooth primary dendrites emerging from the two poles of the soma. After a short distance, these primary dendrites give rise to several secondary and tertiary branches, which either remain within the hilus or terminate in the granule cell layer or molecular layer, sometimes ending in a small terminal tuft (Fig. 8B). The characteristic feature of these neurons is their axonal projection terminating in the outer molecular layer in a particular vertically oriented fashion (Fig. 8B). The main axon emerges from either the soma or one of the primary dendrites (Fig. 8B). Shortly after leaving the soma, the axon gives off several very long axonal collaterals ( <% 900 [micro]m) [less than or equal to 900 microm]. One population then takes a more or less vertical course passing through the granule cell layer, the inner molecular layer, and finally terminating within the outer molecular layer. Within the inner molecular layer, some of these collaterals give rise to tangentially oriented side branches of variable length (30-300 [micro]m) that also terminate within the outer molecular layer. On their way through the granule cell layer, these vertically oriented axonal collaterals form basket-like bouton arrays around granule cell somata. A second population of collaterals establishes a sometimes dense axonal plexus within the hilus, with en passant boutons contacting somata of other hilar neurons.

30651,3100055,"Paired intracellular recordings were used to investigate recurrent excitatory transmission in layers II, III and V of the rat entorhinal cortex in vitro. There was a relatively high probability of finding a recurrent connection between pairs of pyramidal neurons in both layer V (around 12%) and layer III (around 9%). In complete contrast, we have failed to find any recurrent synaptic connections between principal neurons in layer II, and this may be an important factor in the relative resistance of this layer in generating synchronized epileptiform activity. In general, recurrent excitatory postsynaptic potentials in layers III and V of the entorhinal cortex had similar properties to those recorded in other cortical areas, although the probabilities of connection are among the highest reported. Recurrent excitatory postsynaptic potentials recorded in layer V were smaller with faster rise times than those recorded in layer III. In both layers, the recurrent potentials were mediated by glutamate primarily acting at ?-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole receptors, although there appeared to be a slow component mediated by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. In layer III, recurrent transmission failed on about 30% of presynaptic action potentials evoked at 0.2 Hz. This failure rate increased markedly with increasing (2, 3 Hz) frequency of activation. In layer V the failure rate at low frequency was less (19%), and although it increased at higher frequencies this effect was less pronounced than in layer III.

(C) Action potentials elicited by just suprathreshold current pulses in the pyramidal cell (mauve trace), the Ivy cell (orange trace), and a bistratified cell recorded in another experiment (gray trace) are superimposed. The Ivy cell action potential is similar in width to that of the pyramidal cell and is considerably broader than the action potential in the bistratified cell. (D) Composite averages of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) elicited by the pyramidal cell in the Ivy cell, demonstrating the strong paired pulse and brief train depression typical of these inputs. (E) Composite averages of the inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) elicited by the Ivy cell in the pyramidal cell, demonstrating the typically slow time course and paired pulse depression of the IPSPs. (F) Photomicrographs of the Ivy cell at two different magnifications to illustrate a putative synaptic input from the pyramidal cell to the interneuron (red arrows). Two such putative contacts were identified. The lower bouton and contact site is directly above the dendrite and not visible on this micrograph.

We next examined potential consequences of GluN2B deletion in INs on the functional development of glutamatergic synapses. We recorded at P12Ã¯Â¿Â½P13 from INs that can be readily identified in acute hippocampal slices. We selected INs with the cell body in stratum oriens and confirmed IN identity based on the firing pattern and morphology (n = 10; Fig. 5A). We examined evoked synaptic glutamatergic currents in the presence of gabazine (10 ?m) with sequential block of AMPA- and NMDAR-mediated EPSCs (CNQX, 10 ?m, and d-AP5, 50 ?m, respectively; Fig. 5B). In wt mice, all recorded INs exhibited NMDAR-mediated EPSCs. The ratio of NMDAR/AMPAR-mediated eEPSCs was reduced in GluN2B?GAD67 mice compared with age-matched wt littermates (p < 0.001, MannÃ¯Â¿Â½Whitney test; Fig. 5B,E) compatible with the ablation of the dominant GluN2 subunit in postnatal development. Interestingly, the ratio of AMPAR-mediated eEPSCs over gabazine-sensitive eIPSCs was increased in GluN2B?GAD67 mice compared with control littermates (p < 0.001, MannÃ¯Â¿Â½Whitney test; Fig. 5C,F). The paired-pulse ratio of AMPAR-mediated eEPSCs was similar in GluN2B?GAD67 and control neurons (n.s., MannÃ¯Â¿Â½Whitney test; Fig. 5D,G), supporting that the observed amplitude changes reflect postsynaptic alterations.

30824,3100220,"Evidence for subicular inputs to CA1 has appeared in several previous anatomical studies. Berger et al. [5] [1980] examined the anterograde and retrograde transport of HRP [horseradish peroxidase] in rabbit brains. They found that injections into the CA1 cell layer (including the proximal apical and basal dendrites) resulted in anterograde (CA1 to subiculum) label and retrograde (subiculum to CA1) label in subiculum. Injections of tritiated proline or leucine into subiculum showed anterograde label in CA1 stratum oriens (much of this interpreted as fibers headed for the alveus/fimbria) and label in CA1 stratum moleculare (ended at CA2). Finch et al. [8] [1983] traced the dendrites and axons of intracellularly labeled subicular neurons in rat brains. They reported on 12 labeled subicular neurons. Of this group of 12 labeled neurons, four projected only rostrally into the fimbria and three others had both rostrally and caudally directed projections. One of these cells {SUB SUB CA1-Projecting Pyramidal} had collaterals in subiculum with an identified collateral reaching stratum oriens of CA1. Kohler [14] [1985] used extracellular phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) injections into subiculum to trace the region's outputs. Although not discussed at length in the paper, labeled fibers are apparent in CA1 strata oriens and moleculare. It was suggested that at least some of the fibers seen in stratum oriens were actually headed for the alveus rather than directed at CA1. It was also suggested that the projections to stratum moleculare may be directed at distal apical interneurons rather than pyramidal cell dendrites. On the basis of our morphological data and attempts to block propagation by disrupting laminar paths, we conclude that the subicular fibers forming the back projection are present in the apical dendritic region and in the vicinity of the cell layer. We have visualized axons with light microscopic evidence of contacts in stratum radiatum reaching to its border with stratum lacunosum/moleculare, and axons in the cell layer. Our evidence that at least a fraction of these contacts are onto pyramidal neurons comes from the electrophysiological evidence that they mediate the spread of epileptiform events.",p48,11259758,0,data,NULL,synpro_figure,5005,4000,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

The other dendrite descending in the stratum radiatum also reached the stratum lacunosum-moleculare with its thin terminal branches.

30898,3100257,"Some of the first physiological evidence that CA3 axons innervated the dentate gyrus came from studies in hippocampal slices, which showed that a stimulating electrode placed in the hilus could activate an antidromic population spike, recorded extracellularly in the CA3 pyramidal cell layer.Subsequent studies identified what cell types in the dentate gyrus could be influenced by the CA3 projection. Several approaches established that hilar neurons could be activated readily, but granule cells could not.First, fimbria stimulation was used to activate CA3 pyramidal cells instead of the hilus, because antidromic action potentials are easily elicited in CA3 neurons by stimulation at this site, with no evidence for direct activation of hilar neurons and granule cells. Direct activation would be expected because hilar cells that project commissurally have an axon that descends into stratum oriens of CA3b, presumably on its way to the fimbria, but in our slices, we have found that it is severed before reaching the fimbria. Direct activation of granule cells would only be possible if current spread entered stratum lucidum, which recordings show does not occur after fimbria stimulation using the methods we have employed.Extracellular recordings showed that such fimbria stimulation led to antidromic and orthodromic activation of CA3 b and c pyramidal cells, followed by an extracellular negative wave in the granule cell layer and inner molecular layer that reversed polarity in the middle molecular layer (Fig. 2). Due to the negative resting potential of granule cells, the negative potential could reflect an EPSP or depolarized IPSP, and it was shown subsequently by intracellular recording that it was a depolarized GABAA receptor-mediated IPSP (Fig. 3; Scharfman, 1994a, Scharfman, 1994b and Scharfman, 1994c).This fimbria stimulation site activated hilar mossy cells and hilar GABAergic neurons disynaptically, and was sensitive to the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX but not the muscarinic antagonist atropine (Scharfman, 1993a). At a longer latency, the granule cell IPSP began. These data suggesting that fimbria activation of CA3 pyramidal cells led to hilar neuron activation, presumably by hilar collaterals of CA3 pyramidal cells. Comparing the latency to the response of CA3 pyramidal cells and hilar cells supported this hypothesis, because CA3 pyramidal cells were activated at short latency and hilar cells approximately 2 ms later. The same stimulus evoked a long latency IPSP in granule cells, consistent with a CA3-hilar neuron-granule cell pathway. In the presence of bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist, fimbria stimulation evoked EPSPs in granule cells, and did so with a similar latency as the IPSPs, suggesting a CA3-mossy cell-granule cell pathway is normally masked by the activation of GABAergic interneurons by CA3 hilar collaterals (Fig. 3).

Intracellular recordings from granule cells in response to fimbria stimulation in an adult male rat slice illustrate an evoked IPSP that reverses at ?70 mV, indicated a GABAA receptor-mediated IPSP is primarily evoked under normal conditions. After the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline was bath-applied, the evoked response was an EPSP followed by an IPSP that reversed at approximately ?80 mV, suggesting an EPSP followed by a GABAB receptor-mediated IPSP is normally masked by GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition.

The smooth apical dendrite crossed the granule cell layer and bifurcated in the inner molecular layer. Most of the dendritic branches were in the outer third of the molecular layer. The basal dendritic branches remained in the hilus and were covered sparsely with spines (Fig. 5). The principal axon originated from the soma, which gave off several main collaterals that penetrated the granule cell layer. Most axon collaterals coursed in the inner third of the molecular layer (75.5%). However, a significant portion of the axon collaterals (22.6%) remained in the granule cell layer (Fig. 4). Finally, a very small proportion of the collaterals contacted neurons in the hilus proper (Figs 4 and 5C, D).

Mossy cells were recorded simultaneously with their potential targets, granule cells and interneurons. The ?Ã¯Â¿Â½aminobutyric acidÃ¯Â¿Â½A (GABAÃ¯Â¿Â½A) receptor antagonist <i>bicuculline</i> was used in most experiments to block the normally strong inhibitory inputs to granule cells that could mask excitatory effects of mossy cells. Some cells were recorded with electrodes containing the marker Neurobiotin so that their identity could be confirmed morphologically. <br>  <b>2.</b> A mossy cell action potential was immediately followed by a brief depolarization in a granule cell in <b>20 of 1316 pairs (1.5%)</b> that were recorded in the presence of bicuculline. The mean <i>amplitude</i> of depolarizations was <b>1.99Ã¯Â¿Â½0.24</b> (SE) mV when the postsynaptic membrane potential was -55 to -65 mV. Depolarizations could trigger an action potential if the granule cell was depolarized from its resting potential so that its membrane potential was <b>-50 to -60 mV</b>. These data suggest that mossy cells excite granule cells monosynaptically. <br>  <b>3.</b> Monosynaptic excitation of an interneuron by a mossy cell was recorded in <b>4 of 47 (8.5%)</b> simultaneously recorded mossy cells and interneurons, also in the presence of bicuculline. The mean interneuron depolarization was <b>1.64Ã¯Â¿Â½0.29 </b> mV when the interneuron membrane potential was approximately <b>-60 mV</b>. When an interneuron was at its resting potential (-52 to -63 mV), action potentials were often triggered by the depolarizations. <br>  <b>4.</b> Without bicuculline present, mossy cells had no apparent monosynaptic effects on granule cells, as has been previously reported. However, effects that appeared to be polysynaptic were observed in 5 of 92 pairs (5.4%). Specifically, a small, brief hyperpolarization occurred in granule cells 2.5Ã¯Â¿Â½7.3 ms after the peak of a mossy cell action potential. Given the results indicating that mossy cells excite interneurons, and the long latency to onset of the hyperpolarization, one possible explanation for the hyperpolarization is that mossy cells excited interneurons that inhibited granule cells. <br>  <b>5.</b> The results suggest that mossy cells are excitatory neurons. In addition, mossy cells appear to innervate both granule cells and interneurons that are located within several hundred micrometers of the mossy cell soma.

31056,3100389,"The sections were doubleÃ¯Â¿Â½stained for parvalbumin, and the cell innervation pattern of the filled neuron was examined in eight selected sections at various distances from the soma. The contacts formed by the biocytinÃ¯Â¿Â½filled cell on parvalbuminÃ¯Â¿Â½positive dendritic targets were investigated using a 100X oilÃ¯Â¿Â½immersion objective. The number of putative contacts was multiplied by the ratio of the total axon length and the axon length in the selected sections to estimate the total number of synaptic contacts on parvalbuminÃ¯Â¿Â½immunoreactive dendrites (n=1355 contacts). Electron microscopy of five putative contacts revealed symmetrical synapses between biocytinÃ¯Â¿Â½filled presynaptic terminals and parvalbuminÃ¯Â¿Â½immunoreactive postsynaptic dendrites (Fig. 2E, F). Since the axon collaterals were expected to contact several dendrites of the same cell, the dendritic arbors of several parvalbuminÃ¯Â¿Â½immunoreactive neurons (n=10) were reconstructed from neighbouring sections. These reconstructions indicated that the biocytinÃ¯Â¿Â½filled interneuron formed from one to seven putative contacts (median, 3) on the dendrites of a single parvalbuminÃ¯Â¿Â½immunoreactive neuron (Fig. 2D). Typically, these contacts were on different dendrites, but two neighbouring boutons in contact with the same dendrite were also seen occasionally. On the basis of the median number of contacts per neuron and the total number of putative contacts on parvalbuminÃ¯Â¿Â½immunoreactive dendrites, the filled neuron was estimated to innervate 400Ã¯Â¿Â½450 parvalbumin cells. Similar estimates were not available for granule cells. However, since there were 6000Ã¯Â¿Â½10000 boutons in an 80 Ã¯Â¿Â½m section (Fig. 1B), which contains ~8000 granule cells (Seress and Pokorny, 1981; Amaral et al., 199O), it is likely that granule cells are innervated by multiple release sites. Assuming five contacts per granule cell, a single HIPP neuron may innervate ~20% of the possible targets at the level of the cell body.<br> The position of the dendritic arbor, the high density of long spines and the pattern of axonal arborization of the second cell (M280) were very similar to corresponding values for neuron UR13. However, weak immunolabelling of the axon terminals precluded the complete reconstruction of the axon tree. The morphological features of these interneurons were in many respects identical to those of the cell type identified in vitro as the hilar perforant pathwayÃ¯Â¿Â½associated (HIPP) neuron by Han et al.

31098,3100399,"Despite the potential significance of the dentate hilus to memory function (Lisman, 1999) and epilepsy (Sloviter, 1987), little is known about the function of hilar interneurons or the properties of synapses formed by hilar neurons. The absence of functional information about the basic connectivity of the dentate hilus likely relates to both the absence of dense cell body layers (Amaral, 1978) and the frequent spontaneous synaptic responses hilar cells receive in both in vitro brain slices (Scharfman, 1993; Strowbridge and Schwartzkroin, 1996) and in vivo (Buckmaster et al., 1996). Spontaneous synaptic potentials in hilar neurons greatly increase the difficulty of identifying potential monosynaptic connections in this brain region. Responses to large numbers of precisely timed stimuli are required to verify that apparent postsynaptic responses do not reflect synchronous synaptic input or random coincidences of spontaneous events. The paired recordings in Figure 1B illustrate this problem. Putative evoked EPSPs (responses with onset latencies <3 ms, shown within circles) were greatly outnumbered by spontaneous EPSPs that are not correlated with mossy cell spikes. We used an automated post hoc procedure in this study to identify synaptic potentials in each record (see Materials and Methods) and visual inspection of spike-aligned response averages to circumvent this problem, enabling monosynaptic responses evoked between hilar neurons to be defined for the first time.<br> We tested for synaptic connections among 258 hilar neurons in 35 paired, 44 triple, and 14 quadruple simultaneous intracellular recordings in acute rat hippocampal slices. We recorded postsynaptic responses to presynaptic action potentials evoked by two-pulse stimuli (Fig. 1B2) in 502 potential hilar synaptic connections. Both individual event detection methods and average trace analysis (see Materials and Methods) identified the same 9 excitatory and 22 inhibitory synaptic connections, including the excitatory connection shown in Figure 1C (spike-aligned average response from the same paired recording shown in Fig. 1B2) and the inhibitory connection shown in the average postsynaptic response in Figure 1D. All recordings in this study were performed under current-clamp conditions to enable the intrinsic physiology of both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons to be assessed (see below) and to facilitate testing for multiple synaptic connections between groups of neurons within the same episode using staggered sets of current pulses.",p12214-5,19020015,0,data,3200241.png,synpro_figure,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
31099,3100400,"<b>ESTIMATING THE EXPECTED FREQUENCIES OF POLYSYNAPTIC CIRCUIT MOTIFS.</b><br> We estimated expected motif frequency by first multiplying the probabilities of each connection type, assuming independent connection probabilities, and then summing values from all simultaneous recordings to define the expected incidence of each motif (Song et al., 2005). Expected motif frequency was determined by dividing this number by the total number of each motif type that was possible in all simultaneously recorded groups of neurons. We determined the significance of our reciprocal and divergent circuit motifs using binomial cumulative distribution functions (Song et al., 2005) to determine the probability of finding a value larger than the number of observed motifs. For example, we found four reciprocal connections between mossy cells and hilar interneurons of 114 possible pairings of these two cell types, yielding a mossy cell/hilar interneuron reciprocal motif frequency of 3.5%. The constituent monosynaptic connection frequencies in this motif were 6.1% (7 observed mossy cell-to-interneuron connections of 114 possible) and 14.9% (17 observed interneuron-to-mossy cell connections of 114 possible). Given these monosynaptic connection probabilities, we expected reciprocal mossy cell/interneuron connections to occur with a frequency of 0.92% (1.0 expected in 114 pairings). We conclude that this reciprocal connection motif occurred more frequently than expected with a confidence level of p=0.021 (stated conservatively as p<0.05; binomial p=0.92%, n=114; likelihood of four or more motifs computed using binomial cumulative distribution).<br> We estimated the expected frequency of three- and four-cell motifs using Monte Carlo simulations (Press et al., 1992) to replicate the distributions of hilar cell type constellations recorded simultaneously in each experiment. Monosynaptic connections were assigned based on the connection frequencies (Fig. 4B) (e.g., 14.9% of mossy cell/interneuron simultaneous recordings were connected with an inhibitory synapse). Expected motif probabilities were estimated from the frequency that the motif occurred in 108 simulations using the Mersenne Twister random number generator.

31329,3100418,"<b>Macroconnectivity in the CA3 network.</b><br>Our results suggested that connectivity in the CA3 cell network was sparse, with a mean connection probability of 0.92%. Both experimental data and simulations using fully reconstructed CA3 neurons labeled in vivo indicated that connectivity was only moderately dependent on slice orientation (materials and methods; fig. S3). However, connectivity may decline with distance (17). Furthermore, connectivity might be nonrandom, with ensembles of highly connected cells embedded in a sparsely connected population (18, 19). To test these hypotheses, we first examined whether the connection probability was dependent on intersomatic distance (Fig. 2A). The average connection probability did not significantly change with distance, for intersomatic distances of up to 400 Ã¯Â¿Â½m (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, both EPSP and EPSC peak amplitudes were not significantly dependent on distance (fig. S4, A and B).<br>Next, we examined whether synaptic connectivity was random. To test this, we counted all disynaptic connectivity motifs (reciprocal connections, convergent triples, divergent triples, and disynaptic chains) in our experimental data set and compared motif numbers to those of a simulated data set assuming random connectivity and a connection probability of 0.92% (i.e., the experimental value; Fig. 2, B and C). All disynaptic connectivity motifs occurred significantly more frequently than expected by chance. The frequency of reciprocal connections, convergent triples, divergent triples, and disynaptic chains was 6.5-, 2.9-, 6.3-, and 3.4Ã¯Â¿Â½fold higher, respectively, than the corresponding chance level (Fig. 2C; P?0.002 in all cases). Furthermore, we found several superconnectivity motifs (7 connections in one octuple, 10 and 3 connections in two septuples, and 3 connections in two quintuples), which were highly unlikely in random networks (Fig. 2D). As connection probability was not significantly dependent on intersomatic distance (Fig. 2A), the overabundance of motifs was not an epiphenomenon of distance dependence. Thus, connectivity in the CA3 cell network was not random, but highly enriched in connectivity motifs (17Ã¯Â¿Â½19), reminiscent of a smallÃ¯Â¿Â½world network architecture (20). Both connection probability and abundance of motifs were similar in the range of ages tested (fig. S4, C and D). Comparison of properties of connections embedded in disynaptic motifs with those of isolated connections revealed that the EPSC peak amplitude was smaller and the proportion of failures was higher for embedded connections, whereas kinetic parameters were not significantly different (fig. S4E).",p1117,27609885,0,data,NULL,synpro_figure,2000,2000,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

This suggested that these varicosities are indeed presynaptic boutons. To further corroborate this interpretation, their structure was examined at the EM level (n=8 cells; Fig. 10). OLM and SLM varicosities were easily identified by the dark DABÃ¯Â¿Â½reaction product in biocytinÃ¯Â¿Â½filled (Fig. 10A; n=43) and EGFPÃ¯Â¿Â½DABÃ¯Â¿Â½labeled varicosities (Fig. 10A2, B1, B2; n=63).

In 91.8% of the varicosities in the OML and 93.2% in SLM an active zone (the structural equivalent for a functional transmitter release site) with the postsynaptic target structure was established (Fig. 10C1, C2) which further supports the functionality of these varicosities.

31577,3100431,"<b>Properties of pyramidal neurons</b><br> In 11 experiments, involving 56 transverse hippocampal slices, 989 pairs of CA1 pyramidal neurons were tested for synaptic connections. These trials included 134 cells that were held stably for tens of minutes, each of these being tested with up to 20 simultaneously, sequentially recorded pyramidal cells. All cells included in these totals had characteristics typical of CA1 pyramidal neurons. These were fully characterized in 38 of the longerÃ¯Â¿Â½term recordings in which electrode characteristics permitted repeated large current injections and in which no connection was demonstrated. Spike amplitude was 89Ã¯Â¿Â½3.8 mV (meanÃ¯Â¿Â½S.D., range 81Ã¯Â¿Â½94 mV), spike width at halfÃ¯Â¿Â½amplitude was between 0.4 and 0.7 ms, maximum input impedance was 32.9Ã¯Â¿Â½11.3 M? (15Ã¯Â¿Â½68 M?) and at the end of a 200Ã¯Â¿Â½ms -2 nA pulse was always lower, i.e. 20.1Ã¯Â¿Â½5.9 M? (10.4Ã¯Â¿Â½38.0 M?); rebound depolarizations from large negative current pulses were 4.8Ã¯Â¿Â½3.0 mV (1Ã¯Â¿Â½12.2 mV) in amplitude and membrane time constants were 7.5Ã¯Â¿Â½2.9 ms (5.4Ã¯Â¿Â½18.2 ms).

The neurons reported here that were demonstrably involved in a synaptic connection displayed similar characteristics. No evidence could be found to suggest that they formed a distinct subset of pyramidal neurons (see Fig. 2B).

31578,3100432,"From a total of 57 successfully recovered and identified stratum oriens horizontal interneurons, four were judged to be axoÃ¯Â¿Â½axonic cells based on their axonal arborization. This was determined in an initial light microscopic analysis, giving them a Ã¯Â¿Â½chandelierÃ¯Â¿Â½-like appearance (Somogyi, 1977; Somogyi et al., 1985; Buhl et al., 1994) (Fig. 1A,E). Electron microscopic analysis of a random sample of the postsynaptic targets of two of these cells provided unequivocal evidence that this prediction was correct. The following discussion presents a detailed analysis of the properties of these cells. Some of the physiological features are summarized in Table 1.<br><b>Axonal and Dendritic Patterns; Synaptic Targets</b><br> All four cells presented in this report shared the main anatomical feature of a characteristic axonal arbor located primarily in the part of stratum pyramidale adjoining stratum oriens and also in stratum oriens itself (Fig. 1A,E). For two of the cells (cell 240499 and 080299), some boutonÃ¯Â¿Â½bearing axon collaterals also spread into the deep stratum oriens and alveus. Only a few collaterals penetrated the compact layer of stratum pyramidale and stratum radiatum, but when they did, they established radially oriented rows of boutons, the hallmark of axoÃ¯Â¿Â½axonic cells (Fig. 1A,E). Because of the truncation of axonal trees by the slicing procedure, no attempt was made to count the rows of boutons here. The main axons of horizontal axoÃ¯Â¿Â½axonic cells originated in the soma in three cases and from a very proximal dendrite in one case.<br>Electron microscopic analysis of a random sample of 10 postsynaptic targets for each of cell 081298 and 080299 showed that they made synapses exclusively on axon initial segments. Even when the identified bouton was in direct membrane apposition to the cell body of a pyramidal cell, it made no synaptic junction with it, but formed a junction with a nearby AIS. The AIS were recognized by their higher electron opacity than that of dendrites in the same material, and, when present, the electronÃ¯Â¿Â½dense membrane undercoating, microtubule fascicles, and a high density of membranous tubules and large vesicles (Fig. 1F). They only received type II synapses both from the recorded axoÃ¯Â¿Â½axonic cell and from unlabeled boutons, presumably originating in other converging axoaxonic cells (Fig. 1F). These axon initial segments very likely originate in CA1 pyramidal cells, although only three could be followed back to the parent cells within the examined series of sections. The axons did not form appositions with the axon initial segment, soma, or dendrite of the labeled interneurons themselves; therefore, there was no indication of autaptic contacts (Cobb et al., 1997). The axon initial segment of interneurons examined in the rodent hippocampus so far received no synapses, or very few (P. Somogyi, unpublished observation).<br>The soma of all four cells was spindle shaped, elongated parallel with the layers (called the horizontal orientation), with short and long axes of ~10 and 20 Ã¯Â¿Â½m, respectively. Three of the somata were located in stratum oriens about halfway between the stratum pyramidale and the alveus (Fig. 1AÃ¯Â¿Â½C); one was closer to the alveus. The recovery of three of the cells was excellent, and we were able to trace dendrites to their apparent natural ends. One of the cells showed signs of collapse, and the dendrites were filled with HRP reaction product only in patches. Nevertheless, some could be traced up to a 200Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½m distance, and it is unlikely that any major dendrite was missed. Most dendrites emanated from the two poles of the soma and ran parallel with the pyramidal cell layer. Branching occurred mainly at the origin of dendrites and in their most distal parts. The dendrites showing natural ends could be traced for up to ~340 Ã¯Â¿Â½m from the soma, making a total lateral dendritic extent of 400Ã¯Â¿Â½500 Ã¯Â¿Â½m. The dendrites were mostly smooth, with a few filopodial extensions, as is typical in young animals, and with a low density of drumstickÃ¯Â¿Â½shaped spines on two of the cells. Some dendrites emanated from the sides or upper parts of the soma and were truncated by the slicing procedure. We cannot exclude the possibility that some of the truncated dendrites extended into layers outside the stratum oriens, but this was observed only in one of the cells (cell 240499), which had a small dendrite reaching the lower part of stratum radiatum.",p234-5,15098728,0,data,NULL,synpro_figure,4038,4000,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

31590,3100440,"<b>Light and electron microscopic classification of RÃ¯Â¿Â½LM interneurons</b><br>Light microscopic examination revealed that those RÃ¯Â¿Â½LM interneurons with extensive dendritic and axonal labelling (n=22) could be incorporated into at least four distinct, nonÃ¯Â¿Â½overlapping categories. Prominent differences were apparent with regard to the lamination pattern of the axon, innervating circumscribed hippocampal layers and/or showing a highly distinct arborization pattern. In those instances, when the axon appeared to be coÃ¯Â¿Â½laminated with a major glutamatergic hippocampal afferent pathway, such as the perforant pathway, we have followed the terminology originally proposed for dentate gyrus localÃ¯Â¿Â½circuit neurons (Han et al. 1993), which has found relatively widespread acceptance and has been extended to other hippocampal subfields (for review see Freund &amp; BuzsÃ¯Â¿Â½ki, 1996).<br><b>(1)</b> The axon of RÃ¯Â¿Â½LM basket cells (n=4) was confined to the somatic region and adjoining parts of strata radiatum and oriens (Fig. 1A).<br><b>(2)</b> The most abundant type of interneuron, the Schaffer collateral/commissural pathwayÃ¯Â¿Â½associated interneurons (n=10), for reasons of brevity referred to as SchafferÃ¯Â¿Â½associated interneurons, predominantly innervated stratum radiatum and, to a lesser extent, stratum oriens (Figs 2A and ?and3A).3A).<br><b>(3)</b> The axon of perforant pathÃ¯Â¿Â½associated interneurons (n=6) was concentrated in stratum lacunosumÃ¯Â¿Â½moleculare of the CA1 area and could also extend into the molecular layer of both dentate gyrus and subiculum (Fig. 5A).<br><b>(4)</b> The remaining class of localÃ¯Â¿Â½circuit neuron had a very small stellate dendritic tree and an equally compact axonal arbour within strata radiatum and lacunosumÃ¯Â¿Â½moleculare (Figs 6A and ?and7).7). Based on their striking resemblance to a class of previously described neocortical nonÃ¯Â¿Â½principal cells (SzentÃ¯Â¿Â½gothai, 1973) we have thus adopted the term neurogliaform interneurons (n=2).<br>Regarding the efferent connectivity of hippocampal interneurons, the laminar distribution of axonal arbours is already a reasonably good predictor for their postsynaptic domain specificity (GulyÃ¯Â¿Â½s et al. 1993; Halasy &amp; Somogyi, 1993). However, light microscopic predictions are nevertheless insufficient to assess adequately the postsynaptic target preference for particular membrane domains which may overlap within a given lamina, such as, for example, somata, dendrites and axon initial segments being coÃ¯Â¿Â½distributed within the pyramidal cell layer. Within the strata radiatum and lacunosumÃ¯Â¿Â½moleculare potential postsynaptic targets include pyramidal dendrites and spines, the somata of occasional pyramidal cells and the entire somatoÃ¯Â¿Â½dendritic surface of other interneurons. We therefore studied the postsynaptic target distribution of a representative sample of RÃ¯Â¿Â½LM interneurons (n=14; Table 2), using random electron microscopic sampling of vesicleÃ¯Â¿Â½containing axonal boutons (n=231), 164 of which were found to establish a total of 170 synaptic junctions (Fig. 8AÃ¯Â¿Â½K; Table 2). Overall, these data indicate that postsynaptic target profiles are relatively stereotyped within the respective groups (see below), notwithstanding some degree of variability, which may be partially due to the limited sample size (10Ã¯Â¿Â½17 synaptic junctions per cell). Importantly, all cells appeared to favour pyramidal cells as their postsynaptic targets and it is therefore highly probable that none of the cell classes described below overlaps with those categories of RÃ¯Â¿Â½LM interneurons which have been recently shown to target predominantly, if not exclusively, other interneurons (GulyÃ¯Â¿Â½s et al. 1996; AcsÃ¯Â¿Â½dy et al. 1996).",p761,9503336,0,data,NULL,synpro_figure,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

The slices were then reprocessed for nickelÃ¯Â¿Â½DAB staining, and computerÃ¯Â¿Â½aided methods were used to trace the axons. DAB staining was required to detect the extensive axonal arborizations, and the identity of the individual axons was lost at that point. In the reconstructions, the cell somata and initial portions of the axons are shown in color because they were positively identified, but all axons are illustrated in dark gray.

31604,3100453,"<b>Probabilities of inhibitory connections</b><br>Of 263 paired recordings in which a putative basket cell (n=35) was recorded simultaneously with a pyramidal cell (n=263), 57 yielded a monosynaptic IPSP, i.e. an average probability of 1 in 4.6 randomly selected pairs yielding an IPSP (14 of these were too small or too unstable for analysis). There appeared to be some relationship between the distance separating the two cells and the probability of obtaining an inhibitory connection. Pairs within 50Ã¯Â¿Â½100 Ã¯Â¿Â½m of each other yielded probabilities closer to 1 in 2Ã¯Â¿Â½tested pairs (46 : 89 pairs tested), the lowest success rate for close neighbours corresponding to a presynaptic interneuron with an unusually narrow axonal arbour (370 Ã¯Â¿Â½m, 1 : 13). Pairs separated by &gt;150Ã¯Â¿Â½200 Ã¯Â¿Â½m yielded probabilities of 1 : 20 (6 : 120 tested pairs). This matches well the findings of Halasy et al.

31708,3100472,"SpineÃ¯Â¿Â½free calretininÃ¯Â¿Â½immunoreactive (CRÃ¯Â¿Â½IR) interneurons form a subpopulation of GABAergic cells in the rat hippocampus. A characteristic feature of these cells--located in all areas and layers--is the frequent dendroÃ¯Â¿Â½dendritic and axoÃ¯Â¿Â½dendritic contacts they form with each other. In this study we examined in detail the connectivity of these neurons by reconstructing their dendritic and axonal arbor and by identifying their postsynaptic targets. Radially running dendrites of CRÃ¯Â¿Â½IR cells, located in different layers, intermingled into long braids. An average cell was in contact with dendrites of three to seven other CRÃ¯Â¿Â½IR cells. Reconstruction of the dendritic trees from six consecutive sections demonstrated that at least 15 cells may participate in a dendroÃ¯Â¿Â½dendritically connected cluster. Electron microscopical examination revealed that regularly spaced zonula adherentia connect the touching dendrites. The postsynaptic targets of CRÃ¯Â¿Â½IR neurons have been examined using postembedding immunogold staining for GABA.
