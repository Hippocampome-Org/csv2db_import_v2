- inhibitory because GABAergic (Fuentealba et al., 2008)
<p>

- interneuron specific:<br>
&emsp;- 57% of CA1 targets and 100% of SUB targets were interneurons (Fuentealba 2008)<br>
&emsp;- up to half the targets are other interneurons (Somogyi 2010)
<p>

- 11.3% (7/62) of hippocampo-subicular nonpyramidal projection cells were ENK-immunopositive
<p>

- Fuentealba paper refers to these cells as a "population," though only one cell could be positively identified
