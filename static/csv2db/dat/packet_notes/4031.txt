This cell type is a merger of CA1 (-)0102 IS-I and CA1 (-)0112 IS-I
<p>
Previous merger of CA1 (-)0102 IS-I with CA1 0103 O-R (aka oriens-bistratified) was rejected due to the lack of axonal evidence in SO.  Namely, even with six consecutive 80 µm sections, axons were not significantly present.
<p>
According to Gulyás, the CR interneurons in this cell type innervate mostly if not exclusively other GABAergic neurons via multiple synapses

The Hajos 1998 cell is m2-IR.
<p>
The Chittajallu 2013 cell is SOM+.

Besides being m2-IR, the Hajos 1998 cell is also CB-, CCK-, VIP-, PV-, CR+/-, SOM+/-
