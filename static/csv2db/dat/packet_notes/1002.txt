Axonal lengths (avg. of 3 cells): SMo = 4%, SMi = 57%, SG = 7%, H = 26%, CA3 = 3%, CA1 = 1%.

Axonal synapses: H = 15%, SG = 3%, SMi = 82%.

No A:SG contacts in deep SG and only sparse A:SG contacts onto dendritic spines and shafts and a GC soma.

Amaral (1978) states D:SM in young (<14 d) and old (18 m) but not at 28 d.

Ribak et al. (1985) states occasional D:SM_SG but rarely in mature brain.

Dendrites appear to avoid CA3.

Thorny excrescences on proximal dendrites and somata and spines on distal dendrites.

Excitatory asymmetric synapses.

A:H primarily contact GABA-positive dendritic shafts, some somata, and GABA-negative dendritic spines. 

A:SG contact dendritic spines and shafts and GC somata.

A:SMi primarily contact GC proximal dendritic spines.

In LÃ¼bke et al. (1998) some of the youngest rats may be adolescents.

The spiny hilar cells of Scharfman (1990) were considered for this cell type and rejected due to D:SMo_SMi and no axonal information.

The mossy cells of Soltesz et al. (1993) were considered for cell this type and determined to be DG (+)2323 mossy cells in another cell type.
