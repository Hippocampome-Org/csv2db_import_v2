Sik (1995) reports that 91.5% of the axon collaterals are in SLM; only 7% are in SO.  According to hippocampome rules, this represents a below-threshold presence.
<p>
Axonal presence in SR is variable but consists mostly of continuing branches, with the exception of McBain's (1994) Fig 4A.
<p>
Axonal presence in SO is also variable and under threshold.  Unless known connections are reported in the future, this presence will not be counted as per hippocampome rules.
