This cell type is a result of a merger between MEC 000023 pyramidal VI and EC 000023 polymorphic V.
<p>
Likely excitatory cells (Canto 201X MEC preprint -> "sparsely spiny to spiny," projecting; Hamam 2000 -> short spines, projecting).
<p>
Notes on MEC 000023 pyramidal cell type:<br>
- dendrites and axons in the white matter
<p>
Notes on EC 000023 polymorphic cell type:<br>
- weak evidence on axons<br>
- unclear whether dendrites project to the subiculum or to the presubiculum.
