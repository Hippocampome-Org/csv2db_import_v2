                        I am currently reviewing the DG COM-MOPP proposed v2.0 cell. Iâm reviewing the DG MOPP and IS MOPP cells to compare and have a few questions: How do we define the threshold for presence of A/D in either SMo or SMi? Is this primarily based in the pertinent figure description provided by the author, our trained eye, an algorithm to quantify presence based on pixel counting, within a preferred hierarchy of the features I just mentioned, or something entirely different? I think this would really help me with making a determination here, as I do notice that the active v1.0 DG MOPP cells do have at least some axonal presence within SMi. - JDK 08/24/2021
