                        After reviewing DG (i)2101p IS COLTAR Proj [#1104], I am unsure where the evidence of projection to CA1 SLM for this neuron type is coming from. Is this an inference made based off evidence from the on-hold IS-3 projection neuron type? Otherwise I am not seeing any textual evidence or evidence from the provided figures to support this conclusion (Figure 3b from the provided packet does not support a projection to CA1 based on somata locations relative to CA1 in our reference van Strien figure). - JDK 11/22/2021

                                        After taking a closer look at the somata location provided by the authors and comparing their schematic to Figure 1C of van Strien et al., 2009, I think we have been too conservative in our assessment of the somata locations. I now think they are more parallel to the presubiculum and parasubiculum than to the subiculum. - DWW 11/30/2021

                                        I can see this being the case. With that said, should we just not include that it projects? This would constitute a new neuron type just from its A-D pattern in DG. - JDK 11/30/2021

                                        I agree that we should still include this as a new neuron type. I will add comments that the dendrites project outside of the entire hippocampal formation and, therefore, will not be considered in the A-D pattern. - DWW 12/01/2021
