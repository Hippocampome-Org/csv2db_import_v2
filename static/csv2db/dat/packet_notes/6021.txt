Merger with 220233 was rejected.
<p>
Likely excitatory cells (Hamam 2000 -> spiny; Hamam 2002 -> projecting, spiny; Canto 2008 -> spiny, projecting; Canto 201X MEC preprint -> projecting, "principal," sparsely spiny).
<p>
Canto & Witter 2008 schematic remains in this cell type because the authors cite Hamam in the text.  Evidence for D:IV in this schematic is minimal to threshold.
