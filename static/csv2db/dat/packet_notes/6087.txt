Merger of EC (+)023300 pyramid looking III neurons and EC (+)023100 spindle III neurons
<p>   
Inhibitory because they have aspiny dendrites, are nonprojecting, have synapses on dendritic shafts and cell bodies, and have an indented nucleus.
<p>
These cells have a long time constant (p. 3) which is similar to Gloveli type 1 cells which are excitatory spiny pyramidal cells.
