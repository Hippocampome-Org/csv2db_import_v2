                                        I approve the new type, but I'm not convinced by the name. I don't think we should adopt the same name (except for the IS part) for IS and non-IS neurons, as this can create unneeded confusion (I'm already regretting "IS LM-R" vs "LMR" in CA1, but at least we have an extra hyphen there). Perhaps we could consider something like IS-IMOT (inner molecular targeting), but I'm also open to other proposals. - GAA 01/25/2022

                                        I am in agreement with GAA's comments and favor changing the name to either IS IMOT or IS IMOP. As far as choosing between Â the two, I am in favor of IMOT despite the author's referral to these cell as molecular layer-projecting. My rationale is that we have used the "projecting" nomenclature so far to denote axonal presence for a neuron type outside of the layer its somata have been found, and the "targeting" nomenclature for within the same layer. Therefore, I think that IMOT is a better choice for describing this new neuron type. - JDK 01/28/2022
