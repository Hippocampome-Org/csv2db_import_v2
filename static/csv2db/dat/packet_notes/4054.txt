Merger of CA1 (+)2221 pyramidal-like principal (PLP) cells and CA1 (+)2201 radiatum giant cells (RGC).

CA1 PLP 2221 cell type contains unverified connections to SUB and EC.

There is no CLEAR evidence for dendrites in SP in either cell type.

The PLP cell type text mentions "soma located approximately 50 microm from the SP."  Based on the scale bar, basal dendrites are located near the SR/SP border and just within fuzzy boundaries for the principal layer.

The RGC cell type has Gulyas (1998) Fig 2, which shows the soma of cells 1-3 also located about 50-100 microm from the SR/SP border, and it looks like the dendrites have similar extent to PLP cells.  Cell #5 does not have dendrites near SP, so it likely will NOT fit into a 2221 interpretation.

In the PLP cell type, Poolos et al declare PLPs to be a subset of RGCs based on bifurcation patterns of the apical dendrites and soma shape.  However, there appears to be no current basis for hippocampome subclasses.
