Likely excitatory cells (Gloveli -> GABA negative, projecting, EP characteristics similar to principal cells; van Haeften -> spiny; Canto & Witter -> projecting, "principal," sparsely spiny).
<p>
The van Haeften et al. paper does not include mention of projection to Sub or DG.  Possibly lost to slicing or possibly outside the scope of their interest.
<p>
While this morphology appears in Canto's 201X MEC preprint, there is no mention of this morphology in the LEC preprint.
