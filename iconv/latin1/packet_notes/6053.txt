Merger approved with EC 230000 multipolar inhibitory (MPI) II neurons.

Failed unofficial merger with MEC 333000 type 4 III and EC 233000 MPI 1 III.

BC synapse somata of stellate II, pyramidal II, and other neurons

MPI cells are inhibitory, since Germroth describes the cells as nearly spineless, which takes precedence over the fact that they are projecting (axons project to the white matter).

Strong potential for future subclasses because of target specificity and because MPIs project to the hippocampus but there is no evidence that baskets do this.
