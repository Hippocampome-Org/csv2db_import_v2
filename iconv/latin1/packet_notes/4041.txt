- inhibitory because GABAergic (Fuentealba et al., 2008)

- interneuron specific:
      - 57% of CA1 targets and 100% of SUB targets were interneurons
        (Fuentealba 2008)
      - up to half the targets are other interneurons (Somogyi 2010)

- 11.3% (7/62) of hippocampo-subicular nonpyramidal projection cells were ENK-immunopositive

- Fuentealba paper refers to these cells as a "population," though only one cell could be positively identified
