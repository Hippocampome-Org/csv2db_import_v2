                        Based on the morphology and synonym for the DG Total Molecular Layer cell, I’m confused on the usage of the nomenclature for this proposed neuron type for v2.0. These cells do not have axons in either molecular layer nor do they diffusely spread across both molecular layers as exemplified by the DG TML cell type. Based on the provided packet, I am in agreement with the A-D pattern and calling this cell type a basket cell. However I’d like to better understand why the total molecular layer prefix has been appended – can you elaborate on why you had included this prefix for the cell type? - JDK 10/13/2021

                                        You have struck upon one of the more difficult aspect of typing cells, which is what we should name them. I was trying to distinguish them from the canonical 2232 patterning for Basket cells. If you have any ideas for what to call this newly active type, I am all ears. In DG, acronyms are very common, such as HIPP, MOPP, HICAP, etc. - DWW 10/13/2021

                                        Perhaps we could create an acronym for the neuron type based on somata location? Possible names could be MOG (MOlecular Granule) Basket or SMOG (Stratum MOleculare Granule) Basket. From what I gather, nomenclature when using acronyms usually focuses on the use of axon or dendrite location, but no acronyms I could think of were making sense to me (I was thinking of incorporating the evidence that the hilus does not have dendrites or axons into a possible acronym). Let me know what you think. - JDK 10/14/2021

                                        Type approved. Name alternative proposal: BC-GraLDen (granule-like dendrites). Reasoning: MolDen sounds nice but I agree that regular DG basket also have dendrites in molecular layer, so the logic doesn’t parallel that of Mossy MolDen. I also dislike HiLDen because it emphasizes what is missing. In areas CA3-CA1, regular baskets (as opposed to horizontal) are sometimes referred to as having pyramidal-like dendrites, hence the idea of granule-like dendrites here. - GAA 01/19/2022
