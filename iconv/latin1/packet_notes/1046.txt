                        The Savanthrapadian evidence has now been split off into its own packet when it became evident that the Savanthrapadian cells can connect to each other, and the only layer in which that contact can take place is the hilus, resulting in a pattern of 1103. The remaining Liu cell is to be placed On-hold since it is only N = 1, as outlined in the above discussion.

                        I'm fine with the content in the packet, but the Savanthrapadian paper says that only 5% of these cells connect to each other (pg 8201, near the top of the 2nd column). We know therefore that this type is n=6; n=109 were not connected. What do we want to do with the other 109? Would we say that they have A:H? Or might those go into the 1102 HIPP-CAP packet, which would unfreeze it? - CLR 12/08/2015

                                        The page 9 of PDF, I can see 1102 pattern, but these two neurons look borderline to me. Do they penetrate enough into the molecular layer? Cell 1 is a more convincing 1102 to me. Please look at the attached modified packet -> I have tried to separately color the distal axons (see above).

                                        {Savanthrapadian’s paper is good instance of quantum linking to I. I have used the data, and I have mapped the synaptic data to HIPP, HIPP-CAP and recurrent HIPP-CAP cell types. For example, using the data in that paper, one might be able to infer that HIPP and HIPP-CAP cells might be mRNA:SOM+ (supplementary fuzzy inferential linking), and recurrent HIPP-CAP cells are for sure IHC:SOM+ and mRNA:SOM+ (proper linking).} - KM 10/15/2016

                                        I want us to re-evaluate DG 1002 HIPP, 1103 Recurrent HIPP-CAP, and 1102 HIPP-CAP taking into cosideration the best images we have for HIPP. The axons in the 1102 and 1103 packets are very sparse, especially when compared to the HIPP images from the portal (see below). Both of the HIPP neurons have axons in SMI and the hilus. I am not convinced that the proposed new types are different from HIPP. I think further debate is warranted; consequently, I do not appove these types. — CW 10/17/2016

                                        After discussion with Giorgio, we have decided to keep the canonical 1002 HIPP as is. These new cells need to be evaluated relative to that interpretation. - DWW 01/31/2017

                        I still do not see enough evidence to have three types of HIPPy neurons. I think all of the figures in the 1102 packet are too minimally reconstructed to make a call about axons. With this said, having the three types does cover a broad base, is similar to CA1, and is approved by Giorgio, so I will not protest further. - CW 02/01/2017
