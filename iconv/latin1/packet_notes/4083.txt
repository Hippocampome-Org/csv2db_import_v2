That being said, I would not interpret N:A:SP. In directly compsing Ferraguti's [et al., 2005] 0113 trilaminar with Maccaferri's 0103 oriens-bistrat, it looks like Ferraguti's 2nd slice matches the axonal density in the other fig; however, that slice lacks any dendrites or the soma. Ferraguti used [65] [micro]m-thick slices and Maccaferri used 300 [micro]m-thick slices, so 4 of Ferraguti's slice would compare to the 1 of Maccaferri. - DWW

For the ORP class, we have panel F [from Jinno et al., 2007] on p. 5 [of the packet] (with clear axons in SUB:SM_SP and borderline axons in PL). The SUB evidence for the DP class appears to come solely from the schematic [from Jinno et al., 2007] on p. 6 [of the packet] (but the authors state that the axons could not be followed to the terminals). Evidence for CA1 0103 O-R contains an unspecified projection to the SUB. - CLR

                        I agree to have at least one more packet out of this material, and I can go with either pattern [CA1 (i)0102 vs. CA1 (i)0112], but I’m frankly not convinced that we want two distinct neuron types. I believe that in v1.0 we have systematically merged all these cases. Do we have any example of 2 types that only differ in axonal presence in PCL? Unless there’s direct evidence that one of the two makes synapses with the soma and the other does not, I’d probably just merge them. If you agree, I suggest 0112, but am also happy with 0102. If there are other similar cases in v2.0, please consider merging. - GAA 02/01/2022

If we favor the route of merging unless we have direct evidence of one neuron type establishing synapses with the soma while the other does not, which AD pattern should be preferred? The AD pattern exhibited by the majority of the reconstructions or the AD pattern of a single reconstruction that shows axonal presence (e.g. the 0102 & 0112 case that led to this discussion)? Perhaps this should be a case by case basis depending on what evidence makes the most sense to us? - JDK 02/06/2022

                                        I would suggest that we utilize the PCL invoked rule as our fallback position, when we do not have overriding motivation to merge two or more neuron types.

In light of utilizing the PCL invoked rule as a fallback position, I am okay with merging in all cases in the "Axons in the PCL" packet except for the 0103 and 0113 merger where we have a text description directly stating that the X-OPR (0113 O-RPO) axons display en passant boutons in SP whereas the X-OR (0103 O-BiC) do not. - JDK 02/07/2022
