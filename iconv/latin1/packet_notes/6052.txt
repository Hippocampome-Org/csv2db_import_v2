This cell type is a result of a merger between MEC 000023 pyramidal VI and EC 000023 polymorphic V.

Likely excitatory cells (Canto 201X MEC preprint -> "sparsely spiny to spiny," projecting; Hamam 2000 -> short spines, projecting).

Notes on MEC 000023 pyramidal cell type:
- dendrites and axons in the white matter

Notes on EC 000023 polymorphic cell type:
- weak evidence on axons
- unclear whether dendrites project to the subiculum or to the presubiculum.
