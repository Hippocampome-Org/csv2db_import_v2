Granule cells have two main, radially oriented, spiny dendrites emitting several fine branches, which reach the hippocampal fissure. The axons of the granule cells, the mossy fiber axons, originate from the opposite pole of the soma relative to the dendrites, and enter the dentate hilus, where they give rise to several collaterals (Claiborne et al., 1986). Recurrent collaterals periodically enter the granule cell layer, climb along the cell bodies and dendrites of presumed basket cells, and form synapses (Ribak and Peterson, 1991). The main axonal projection of the granule cells leaves the hilar region and courses through the stratum lucidum of the CA3 subfield, where it forms the giant mossy terminals synapsing on the proximal dendrites of pyramidal cells.","p64, right upper","Leranth C, Hajszan T","Extrinsic afferent systems to the dentate gyrus","Progress in Brain Research",2007,17765712,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Thus, the Schaffer collaterals are as highly associated with the apical dendrites of CA1 cells in the stratum radiatum as they are with the basal dendrites in the stratum oriens.","p74, left lower","Amaral D, Lavenex P","Hippocampal Neuroanatomy","The Hippocampus Book",2049,"978-0-19-510027-3",37,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

These somata contain a round nucleus without infoldings, a thick shell of perikaryal cytoplasm and abundant organelles (Fig. 4). Arising from these somata are three or four thick primary dendrites (Fig. 4), which bifurcate to form an elaborate dendritic plexus that is mostly restricted to the hilus. These cells have complex spines known as thorny excrescences on their somata and proximal dendrites (Fig. 4), while their distal dendrites have typical spines.

Although the extent of local arborization is limited, axon collaterals are present in the str. oriens and to a lower degree in the radiatum. These collaterals provide a major excitatory input to interneurons providing feedback inhibition, in particular to somatostatin-immunopositive, O-LM interneurons (Blasco-Ibanez and Freund, 1995; Katona et al., 1999a; Csicsvari et al., 1998; Maccaferri et al., 2000). Additionally, these collaterals also form synapses onto neighboring CA1 pyramidal cells; however, the recurrent connectivity in the CA1 area is very low at only ~1% (Deuchars and Thomson, 1996).","p33 middle","Vida I","Morphology of Hippocampal Neurons","Hippocampal Microcircuits",2010,"978-1-4419-0995-4",27,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

While the extent of the dendrites is restricted along the septo-temporal axis (<500pim), the axon can cover 53-61% of the hippocampus (Buckmaster et al., 1996). Thus, mossy cells provide a distributed excitatory feedback to the DG [Dentate gyrus]. The ipsilateral length of the axon is between 73 and 96 mm (uncorrected two-dimensional projection, Buckmaster et al., 1996). Most of the axon is in the inner molecular layer (53-56%) and the hilus (23-27%) but collaterals are also found in the granule cell layer, the middle molecular layer, the CA3, and occasionally also in the CA1 (Buckmaster et al., 1996). In the molecular layer, the axon forms synapses every ~2 microm and the large majority of the postsynaptic targets are dendritic spines of GCs [granule cells] (Buckmaster et al., 1996). While numerically low, synaptic contacts onto interneurons have been suggested to play an important role in regulating the excitability of the DG (Ratzliff et al., 2002; Sloviter et al., 2003).","p40 middle","Vida I","Morphology of Hippocampal Neurons","Hippocampal Microcircuits",2010,"978-1-4419-0995-4",27,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

However, in contrast to the densely spinous dendrites of the pyramidal cell, the dendrites of the chandelier cell exhibited only a few dendritic spines (Fig. 2C) and some dendrites were completely spine free. Numerous small dendritic branches, many of them reaching the ventricular surface of the hippocampus, were found among the axons of the alveus. The major apical dendrite terminated in a dense tuft in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (Figs. 1 A, 2D) similar to that of pyramidal cells, but more restricted in lateral extent. The other dendrite descending in the stratum radiatum also reached the stratum lacunosum-moleculare with its thin terminal branches. However, as the dendrite coursed temporally, it falsely appears to terminate in the stratum radiatum (Fig. 1 A) due to the curvature of the laminar boundaries in three dimensions which could not be represented in a two dimensional reconstruction. The dendritic arborization is located medial and asymmetric to the axonal field and covers an area of about 200 by 300 [micro]m as viewed in the tangential plane (Fig. 1C). The dendritic branches in the alveus and stratum oriens are in the same position as the local axon collaterals of the pyramidal cells. This could easily be established, since in addition to the chandelier cell, a well-filled pyramidal cell was also present whose axon collaterals mixed with the chandelier cell {CA1 CA1 Axo-Axonic} dendrites.

[5] [1980] examined the anterograde and retrograde transport of HRP [horseradish peroxidase] in rabbit brains. They found that injections into the CA1 cell layer (including the proximal apical and basal dendrites) resulted in anterograde (CA1 to subiculum) label and retrograde (subiculum to CA1) label in subiculum. Injections of tritiated proline or leucine into subiculum showed anterograde label in CA1 stratum oriens (much of this interpreted as fibers headed for the alveus/fimbria) and label in CA1 stratum moleculare (ended at CA2). Finch et al. [8] [1983] traced the dendrites and axons of intracellularly labeled subicular neurons in rat brains. They reported on 12 labeled subicular neurons. Of this group of 12 labeled neurons, four projected only rostrally into the fimbria and three others had both rostrally and caudally directed projections. One of these cells {SUB SUB CA1-Projecting Pyramidal} had collaterals in subiculum with an identified collateral reaching stratum oriens of CA1. Kohler [14] [1985] used extracellular phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) injections into subiculum to trace the region's outputs. Although not discussed at length in the paper, labeled fibers are apparent in CA1 strata oriens and moleculare. It was suggested that at least some of the fibers seen in stratum oriens were actually headed for the alveus rather than directed at CA1. It was also suggested that the projections to stratum moleculare may be directed at distal apical interneurons rather than pyramidal cell dendrites. On the basis of our morphological data and attempts to block propagation by disrupting laminar paths, we conclude that the subicular fibers forming the back projection are present in the apical dendritic region and in the vicinity of the cell layer. We have visualized axons with light microscopic evidence of contacts in stratum radiatum reaching to its border with stratum lacunosum/moleculare, and axons in the cell layer. Our evidence that at least a fraction of these contacts are onto pyramidal neurons comes from the electrophysiological evidence that they mediate the spread of epileptiform events.","p48, left top","Harris E, Stewart M","Propagation of synchronous epileptiform events from subiculum backward into area CA1 of rat brain slices.","Brain Res",2001,11259758,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

The axon of the basket cell was similar to those published earlier, 31 therefore only the branches innervating the putative bistratiÞed cell are indicated for clarity. The postsynaptic cell gives rise to two main axons, which emerge from the basal portion of the soma. The inset indicates all electron microscopically identiÞed sites of synaptic contact (n=12; see Fig. 3) made by 10 boutons of the presynaptic basket cell axon onto the postsynaptic bistratiÞed cell. In two instances (marked with an asterisk), a single bouton formed two active zones, so that in total, seven synaptic junctions were made onto the soma and the remaining Þve onto proximal dendritic shafts.

This can be largely explained by the proposed same proximal dendritic synapse location (Fig. 3A). Moreover, precision in GABA release defined as the CV of synaptic latency was comparably low (HICAPÐBC: 0.46 ± 0.07 vs HICAPÐHICAP: 0.43 ± 0.08, p = 0.874; Figs. 2A and 6B).","p8203 right middle","Savanthrapadian S, Meyer T, Elgueta C, Booker SA, Vida I, Bartos M","Synaptic properties of SOM- and CCK-expressing cells in dentate gyrus interneuron networks","J Neurosci",2014,24920624,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

One explanation for this discrepancy is very likely to be the distal location of HIPP-mediated contacts at postsynaptic apical BC dendrites, which will cause longer delays in action potential conduction in contrast to the proposed proximal contacts among interconnected HIPP cells (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed bouton-like structures of HIPP axons in close apposition to apical BC dendrites in the middle molecular layer (3 HIPPÐBC pairs; Fig. 6B).","p8203 right bottom","Savanthrapadian S, Meyer T, Elgueta C, Booker SA, Vida I, Bartos M","Synaptic properties of SOM- and CCK-expressing cells in dentate gyrus interneuron networks","J Neurosci",2014,24920624,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

2000038,2004,"CA3c Pyramidal (+)03223p",1000,"DG Granule (+)2201p","Some of the first physiological evidence that CA3 axons innervated the dentate gyrus came from studies in hippocampal slices, which showed that a stimulating electrode placed in the hilus could activate an antidromic population spike, recorded extracellularly in the CA3 pyramidal cell layer.Subsequent studies identified what cell types in the dentate gyrus could be influenced by the CA3 projection. Several approaches established that hilar neurons could be activated readily, but granule cells could not. First, fimbria stimulation was used to activate CA3 pyramidal cells instead of the hilus, because antidromic action potentials are easily elicited in CA3 neurons by stimulation at this site, with no evidence for direct activation of hilar neurons and granule cells. Direct activation would be expected because hilar cells that project commissurally have an axon that descends into stratum oriens of CA3b, presumably on its way to the fimbria, but in our slices, we have found that it is severed before reaching the fimbria. Direct activation of granule cells would only be possible if current spread entered stratum lucidum, which recordings show does not occur after fimbria stimulation using the methods we have employed. Extracellular recordings showed that such fimbria stimulation led to antidromic and orthodromic activation of CA3 b and c pyramidal cells, followed by an extracellular negative wave in the granule cell layer and inner molecular layer that reversed polarity in the middle molecular layer (Fig. 2). Due to the negative resting potential of granule cells, the negative potential could reflect an EPSP or depolarized IPSP, and it was shown subsequently by intracellular recording that it was a depolarized GABAA receptor-mediated IPSP (Fig. 3; Scharfman, 1994a, Scharfman, 1994b and Scharfman, 1994c). This fimbria stimulation site activated hilar mossy cells and hilar GABAergic neurons disynaptically, and was sensitive to the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX but not the muscarinic antagonist atropine (Scharfman, 1993a). At a longer latency, the granule cell IPSP began. These data suggesting that fimbria activation of CA3 pyramidal cells led to hilar neuron activation, presumably by hilar collaterals of CA3 pyramidal cells. Comparing the latency to the response of CA3 pyramidal cells and hilar cells supported this hypothesis, because CA3 pyramidal cells were activated at short latency and hilar cells approximately 2 ms later. The same stimulus evoked a long latency IPSP in granule cells, consistent with a CA3-hilar neuron-granule cell pathway. In the presence of bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist, fimbria stimulation evoked EPSPs in granule cells, and did so with a similar latency as the IPSPs, suggesting a CA3-mossy cell-granule cell pathway is normally masked by the activation of GABAergic interneurons by CA3 hilar collaterals (Fig. 3). Additional studies revealed that the GABAergic neurons may not only involve those in the hilus, but also the Òbasket cellsÓ of the granule cell layer (Scharfman, 1994a and Scharfman, 1994c; Kneisler and Dingledine, 1995).","p630 right","Scharfman HE","The CA3 backprojection to the dentate gyrus","Prog Brain Res",2007,17765742,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
2000038,2004,"CA3c Pyramidal (+)03223p",1002,"DG Mossy","Some of the first physiological evidence that CA3 axons innervated the dentate gyrus came from studies in hippocampal slices, which showed that a stimulating electrode placed in the hilus could activate an antidromic population spike, recorded extracellularly in the CA3 pyramidal cell layer.Subsequent studies identified what cell types in the dentate gyrus could be influenced by the CA3 projection. Several approaches established that hilar neurons could be activated readily, but granule cells could not. First, fimbria stimulation was used to activate CA3 pyramidal cells instead of the hilus, because antidromic action potentials are easily elicited in CA3 neurons by stimulation at this site, with no evidence for direct activation of hilar neurons and granule cells. Direct activation would be expected because hilar cells that project commissurally have an axon that descends into stratum oriens of CA3b, presumably on its way to the fimbria, but in our slices, we have found that it is severed before reaching the fimbria. Direct activation of granule cells would only be possible if current spread entered stratum lucidum, which recordings show does not occur after fimbria stimulation using the methods we have employed. Extracellular recordings showed that such fimbria stimulation led to antidromic and orthodromic activation of CA3 b and c pyramidal cells, followed by an extracellular negative wave in the granule cell layer and inner molecular layer that reversed polarity in the middle molecular layer (Fig. 2).

Therefore, the CA3c population of ventral hippocampus appears to be a subset of CA3 pyramidal cells with the highest potential for dentate gyrus interactions. These studies were the first to define hilar collateralization of CA3 neurons unequivocally. However, one caveat was that the sample sizes were small, and it remains unclear exactly how representative the data were of the entire CA3 population.

There was a relatively high probability of finding a recurrent connection between pairs of pyramidal neurons in both layer V (around 12%) and layer III (around 9%). In complete contrast, we have failed to find any recurrent synaptic connections between principal neurons in layer II, and this may be an important factor in the relative resistance of this layer in generating synchronized epileptiform activity. In general, recurrent excitatory postsynaptic potentials in layers III and V of the entorhinal cortex had similar properties to those recorded in other cortical areas, although the probabilities of connection are among the highest reported. Recurrent excitatory postsynaptic potentials recorded in layer V were smaller with faster rise times than those recorded in layer III. In both layers, the recurrent potentials were mediated by glutamate primarily acting at _-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole receptors, although there appeared to be a slow component mediated by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. In layer III, recurrent transmission failed on about 30% of presynaptic action potentials evoked at 0.2 Hz. This failure rate increased markedly with increasing (2, 3 Hz) frequency of activation. In layer V the failure rate at low frequency was less (19%), and although it increased at higher frequencies this effect was less pronounced than in layer III. Finally, in layer III, there was evidence for a relatively high probability of electrical coupling between pyramidal neurons.","Abstract","Dhillon A, Jones RS.","Laminar differences in recurrent excitatory transmission in the rat entorhinal cortex in vitro","Neuroscience",2000,11029534,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

To understand the function of these interneurons in information processing, it is necessary to uncover how they are embedded into neuronal circuits. Therefore, the proportion of GABAergic terminals expressing CB1 and the morphological and electrophysiological properties of CB1-immunoreactive interneurons should be revealed. We investigated the ratio and the origin of CB1-expressing inhibitory boutons in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Using immunocytochemical techniques, we estimated that _40% of GABAergic axon terminals in different layers of CA3 also expressed CB1. To identify the inhibitory cell types expressing CB1 in this region, we recorded and intracellularly labeled interneurons in hippocampal slices. CB1-expressing interneurons showed distinct axonal arborization, and were classified as basket cells, mossy-fiber-associated cells, dendritic-layer-innervating cells or perforant-path-associated cells. In each morphological category, a substantial variability in axonal projection was observed. In contrast to the diverse morphology, the active and passive membrane properties were found to be rather similar.

The axon of the pyramidal cell formed 15 295 boutons, 63.8% of which were in stratum oriens, 15.4% in stratum pyramidale and 20.8% in stratum radiatum. Only 2.1% of the axon terminals contacted parvalbumin-positive neurons. Most of these were single contacts (84.7%), but double or triple contacts (15.3%) were also found. The majority of the boutons terminated on dendrites (84.1%) of parvalbumin-positive cells, less frequently on cell bodies (15.9%). In order to estimate the proportion of contacts representing synapses, 16 light microscopically identified contacts between boutons of the filled pyramidal cell axon and the parvalbumin-positive targets were examined by correlated electron microscopy. Thirteen of them were found to be asymmetrical synapses, and in the remaining three cases synapses between the labelled profiles could not be confirmed. We conclude that the physiologically effective excitatory connections between single pyramidal cells and postsynaptic inhibitory neurons are mediated by a small number of contacts, mostly by a single synapse. This results in a high degree of convergence and divergence in hippocampal networks.","Abstract","Sik A, Tamamaki N, Freund TF","Complete axon arborization of a single CA3 pyramidal cell in the rat hippocampus, and its relationship with postsynaptic parvalbumin-containing interneurons","Eur J Neurosci",1993,8124522,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

We found that ZnT3 and VGluT1 double-positive presynaptic clusters were located on RGS14-positive dendrites (Fig. 2c,d).

Most axon collaterals coursed in the inner third of the molecular layer (75.5%). However, a significant portion of the axon collaterals (22.6%) remained in the granule cell layer (Fig. 4).

A representative example of an aspiny hilar interneuron with an axonal projection to the outer molecular layer is given in Fig. 8B. These neurons (n =4) usually had somata located within the deep hilus, 20-50 [micro]m beneath the granule cell layer, and were fusiform in shape, with two- to four thick smooth primary dendrites emerging from the two poles of the soma. After a short distance, these primary dendrites give rise to several secondary and tertiary branches, which either remain within the hilus or terminate in the granule cell layer or molecular layer, sometimes ending in a small terminal tuft (Fig. 8B). The characteristic feature of these neurons is their axonal projection terminating in the outer molecular layer in a particular vertically oriented fashion (Fig. 8B). The main axon emerges from either the soma or one of the primary dendrites (Fig. 8B). Shortly after leaving the soma, the axon gives off several very long axonal collaterals ( <% 900 [micro]m) [less than or equal to 900 microm]. One population then takes a more or less vertical course passing through the granule cell layer, the inner molecular layer, and finally terminating within the outer molecular layer. Within the inner molecular layer, some of these collaterals give rise to tangentially oriented side branches of variable length (30-300 [micro]m) that also terminate within the outer molecular layer. On their way through the granule cell layer, these vertically oriented axonal collaterals form basket-like bouton arrays around granule cell somata. A second population of collaterals establishes a sometimes dense axonal plexus within the hilus, with en passant boutons contacting somata of other hilar neurons. Some of these collaterals were seen to project to CA3c (Fig. 8B).","p1526, left bot","Lubke J, Frotscher M, Spruston N","Specialized electrophysiological properties of anatomically identified neurons in the hilar region of the rat fascia dentata","J Neurophysiol",1998,9497429,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Slices were maintained at the interface between artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing (in mM): 126 $Cl, 3 $Cl, 1.25 NaH 2 P0 4 , 24 NaHC0 3 , 2 MgS0 4, 2 CaCI 2 , 10 glucose, pH 7.2, and a humidified atmosphere of 95% 0 2 and 5% C0 2 , at 34-35 �C. Sharp glass microelectrodes contained 2% biocytin in 1.5 M potassium methylsulphate and were bevelled to a d.c. resistance of 60-150 MQ. Recovered biocytin-labelled cells were analysed in the light microscope and target selectivity was determined by electron microscopy for a total of 94 basket cell and 22 axo-axonic cell synaptic contacts, ranging from 6 to 24 contacts per cell. All values are expressed as means � s.d. The number of synaptically coupled pairs exceeds the number of interneurons because the latter could serve as the presynaptic partner for more than one recorded pyramidal cell.","p76",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,7477292,0,"CA1 Basket?CA1 PC",NULL,NULL,2000076

The axon of the pyramidal cell formed 15 295 boutons, 63.8% of which were in stratum oriens, 15.4% in stratum pyramidale and 20.8% in stratum radiatum. Only 2.1% of the axon terminals contacted parvalbumin-positive neurons. Most of these were single contacts (84.7%), but double or triple contacts (15.3%) were also found. The majority of the boutons terminated on dendrites (84.1%) of parvalbumin-positive cells, less frequently on cell bodies (15.9%). In order to estimate the proportion of contacts representing synapses, 16 light microscopically identified contacts between boutons of the filled pyramidal cell axon and the parvalbumin-positive targets were examined by correlated electron microscopy. Thirteen of them were found to be asymmetrical synapses, and in the remaining three cases synapses between the labelled profiles could not be confirmed. We conclude that the physiologically effective excitatory connections between single pyramidal cells and postsynaptic inhibitory neurons are mediated by a small number of contacts, mostly by a single synapse. This results in a high degree of convergence and divergence in hippocampal networks.","Abstract",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,8124522,0,"CA3 pc?CA3 Axo-axo",NULL,NULL,2000066

These neurons (n �=4) usually had somata located within the deep hilus, 20-50 [micro]m beneath the granule cell layer, and were fusiform in shape, with two- to four thick smooth primary dendrites emerging from the two poles of the soma. After a short distance, these primary dendrites give rise to several secondary and tertiary branches, which either remain within the hilus or terminate in the granule cell layer or molecular layer, sometimes ending in a small terminal tuft (Fig. 8B). The characteristic feature of these neurons is their axonal projection terminating in the outer molecular layer in a particular vertically oriented fashion (Fig. 8B). The main axon emerges from either the soma or one of the primary dendrites (Fig. 8B). Shortly after leaving the soma, the axon gives off several very long axonal collaterals ( <% 900 [micro]m) [less than or equal to 900 microm]. One population then takes a more or less vertical course passing through the granule cell layer, the inner molecular layer, and finally terminating within the outer molecular layer.

In complete contrast, we have failed to find any recurrent synaptic connections between principal neurons in layer II, and this may be an important factor in the relative resistance of this layer in generating synchronized epileptiform activity. In general, recurrent excitatory postsynaptic potentials in layers III and V of the entorhinal cortex had similar properties to those recorded in other cortical areas, although the probabilities of connection are among the highest reported. Recurrent excitatory postsynaptic potentials recorded in layer V were smaller with faster rise times than those recorded in layer III. In both layers, the recurrent potentials were mediated by glutamate primarily acting at ?-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole receptors, although there appeared to be a slow component mediated by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. In layer III, recurrent transmission failed on about 30% of presynaptic action potentials evoked at 0.2 Hz. This failure rate increased markedly with increasing (2, 3 Hz) frequency of activation. In layer V the failure rate at low frequency was less (19%), and although it increased at higher frequencies this effect was less pronounced than in layer III.

Additionally, in agreement with the presence of mossy fiber terminals on aspiny calretinin-positive interneurons (Acsady et al., 1998), 15 mossy fibers are expected to synapse onto IS [interneuron specific] cells. Since mossy fibers avoid the molecular layer (Buckmaster and Dudek, 1999) in the healthy dentate gyrus, it is assumed that they do not contact MOPP [molecular layer perforant path-associated] cells.","p644",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,17765743,0,"GC?HIPP",NULL,NULL,1001303

To understand the function of these interneurons in information processing, it is necessary to uncover how they are embedded into neuronal circuits. Therefore, the proportion of GABAergic terminals expressing CB1 and the morphological and electrophysiological properties of CB1-immunoreactive interneurons should be revealed. We investigated the ratio and the origin of CB1-expressing inhibitory boutons in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Using immunocytochemical techniques, we estimated that ?40% of GABAergic axon terminals in different layers of CA3 also expressed CB1. To identify the inhibitory cell types expressing CB1 in this region, we recorded and intracellularly labeled interneurons in hippocampal slices. CB1-expressing interneurons showed distinct axonal arborization, and were classified as basket cells, mossy-fiber-associated cells, dendritic-layer-innervating cells or perforant-path-associated cells. In each morphological category, a substantial variability in axonal projection was observed. In contrast to the diverse morphology, the active and passive membrane properties were found to be rather similar.

Injections of tritiated proline or leucine into subiculum showed anterograde label in CA1 stratum oriens (much of this interpreted as fibers headed for the alveus/fimbria) and label in CA1 stratum moleculare (ended at CA2). Finch et al. [8] [1983] traced the dendrites and axons of intracellularly labeled subicular neurons in rat brains. They reported on 12 labeled subicular neurons. Of this group of 12 labeled neurons, four projected only rostrally into the fimbria and three others had both rostrally and caudally directed projections. One of these cells {SUB SUB CA1-Projecting Pyramidal} had collaterals in subiculum with an identified collateral reaching stratum oriens of CA1. Kohler [14] [1985] used extracellular phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) injections into subiculum to trace the region's outputs. Although not discussed at length in the paper, labeled fibers are apparent in CA1 strata oriens and moleculare. It was suggested that at least some of the fibers seen in stratum oriens were actually headed for the alveus rather than directed at CA1. It was also suggested that the projections to stratum moleculare may be directed at distal apical interneurons rather than pyramidal cell dendrites. On the basis of our morphological data and attempts to block propagation by disrupting laminar paths, we conclude that the subicular fibers forming the back projection are present in the apical dendritic region and in the vicinity of the cell layer. We have visualized axons with light microscopic evidence of contacts in stratum radiatum reaching to its border with stratum lacunosum/moleculare, and axons in the cell layer. Our evidence that at least a fraction of these contacts are onto pyramidal neurons comes from the electrophysiological evidence that they mediate the spread of epileptiform events.","p48",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,11259758,0,"SUB CA1-Proj Pyr?CA1 Pyr",NULL,NULL,1007168

However, in contrast to the densely spinous dendrites of the pyramidal cell, the dendrites of the chandelier cell exhibited only a few dendritic spines (Fig. 2C) and some dendrites were completely spine free. Numerous small dendritic branches, many of them reaching the ventricular surface of the hippocampus, were found among the axons of the alveus. The major apical dendrite terminated in a dense tuft in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (Figs. 1 A, 2D) similar to that of pyramidal cells, but more restricted in lateral extent. The other dendrite descending in the stratum radiatum also reached the stratum lacunosum-moleculare with its thin terminal branches. However, as the dendrite coursed temporally, it falsely appears to terminate in the stratum radiatum (Fig. 1 A) due to the curvature of the laminar boundaries in three dimensions which could not be represented in a two dimensional reconstruction. The dendritic arborization is located medial and asymmetric to the axonal field and covers an area of about 200 by 300 [micro]m as viewed in the tangential plane (Fig. 1C).

Several approaches established that hilar neurons could be activated readily, but granule cells could not.First, fimbria stimulation was used to activate CA3 pyramidal cells instead of the hilus, because antidromic action potentials are easily elicited in CA3 neurons by stimulation at this site, with no evidence for direct activation of hilar neurons and granule cells. Direct activation would be expected because hilar cells that project commissurally have an axon that descends into stratum oriens of CA3b, presumably on its way to the fimbria, but in our slices, we have found that it is severed before reaching the fimbria. Direct activation of granule cells would only be possible if current spread entered stratum lucidum, which recordings show does not occur after fimbria stimulation using the methods we have employed.Extracellular recordings showed that such fimbria stimulation led to antidromic and orthodromic activation of CA3 b and c pyramidal cells, followed by an extracellular negative wave in the granule cell layer and inner molecular layer that reversed polarity in the middle molecular layer (Fig. 2). Due to the negative resting potential of granule cells, the negative potential could reflect an EPSP or depolarized IPSP, and it was shown subsequently by intracellular recording that it was a depolarized GABAA receptor-mediated IPSP (Fig. 3; Scharfman, 1994a, Scharfman, 1994b and Scharfman, 1994c).This fimbria stimulation site activated hilar mossy cells and hilar GABAergic neurons disynaptically, and was sensitive to the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX but not the muscarinic antagonist atropine (Scharfman, 1993a).

These data suggesting that fimbria activation of CA3 pyramidal cells led to hilar neuron activation, presumably by hilar collaterals of CA3 pyramidal cells. Comparing the latency to the response of CA3 pyramidal cells and hilar cells supported this hypothesis, because CA3 pyramidal cells were activated at short latency and hilar cells approximately 2 ms later.

In the dorsal hippocampus only one out of seven CA3c/zone 3 cells had axons that penetrated through the granule cell layer and terminated in the inner third of the molecular layer. The neuron (R82) was located at the proximal end of the CA3c pyramidal layer and all other labeled neurons were distal to it. In the ventral hippocampus, 3 out of 3 CA3 pyramidal cells {CA3c CA3c (e)03223p (000S0) Pyramidal} had extensive projections to the inner molecular layer. One of them (R60) was near the border of CA3c/Ca3b and had a moderate amount of axon collaterals in the suprapyramidal molecular layer. The other two neurons (R32 pair) were located close to the proximal end of CA3c. These cells projected to both the suprapyramidal and infrapyramidal parts of the molecular layer. The density of axons in the inner molecular layer was very high and in fact denser than the axon collaterals of intracellularly labeled mossy cells in vivo (Soltesz and Deschenes, '92).","p204",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,8300905,0,"CA3c Pyr?GC",NULL,NULL,1006020

The dendrites of spiny SPR-positive cells, and some aspiny neurons as well, give rise to a profuse dendritic arbour in the hilus (Nakaya et al., 1994; Acsady et al.,1995b) which perfectly overlaps with the VIP-positive hilar axonal plexus.

Mossy cells were recorded simultaneously with their potential targets, granule cells and interneurons. The ?�aminobutyric acid�A (GABA�A) receptor antagonist <i>bicuculline</i> was used in most experiments to block the normally strong inhibitory inputs to granule cells that could mask excitatory effects of mossy cells. Some cells were recorded with electrodes containing the marker Neurobiotin so that their identity could be confirmed morphologically. <br>  <b>2.</b> A mossy cell action potential was immediately followed by a brief depolarization in a granule cell in <b>20 of 1316 pairs (1.5%)</b> that were recorded in the presence of bicuculline. The mean <i>amplitude</i> of depolarizations was <b>1.99�0.24</b> (SE) mV when the postsynaptic membrane potential was -55 to -65 mV. Depolarizations could trigger an action potential if the granule cell was depolarized from its resting potential so that its membrane potential was <b>-50 to -60 mV</b>. These data suggest that mossy cells excite granule cells monosynaptically. <br>  <b>3.</b> Monosynaptic excitation of an interneuron by a mossy cell was recorded in <b>4 of 47 (8.5%)</b> simultaneously recorded mossy cells and interneurons, also in the presence of bicuculline. The mean interneuron depolarization was <b>1.64�0.29 </b> mV when the interneuron membrane potential was approximately <b>-60 mV</b>. When an interneuron was at its resting potential (-52 to -63 mV), action potentials were often triggered by the depolarizations. <br>  <b>4.</b> Without bicuculline present, mossy cells had no apparent monosynaptic effects on granule cells, as has been previously reported. However, effects that appeared to be polysynaptic were observed in 5 of 92 pairs (5.4%). Specifically, a small, brief hyperpolarization occurred in granule cells 2.5�7.3 ms after the peak of a mossy cell action potential. Given the results indicating that mossy cells excite interneurons, and the long latency to onset of the hyperpolarization, one possible explanation for the hyperpolarization is that mossy cells excited interneurons that inhibited granule cells. <br>  <b>5.</b> The results suggest that mossy cells are excitatory neurons. In addition, mossy cells appear to innervate both granule cells and interneurons that are located within several hundred micrometers of the mossy cell soma.

The contacts formed by the biocytin�filled cell on parvalbumin�positive dendritic targets were investigated using a 100X oil�immersion objective. The number of putative contacts was multiplied by the ratio of the total axon length and the axon length in the selected sections to estimate the total number of synaptic contacts on parvalbumin�immunoreactive dendrites (n=1355 contacts). Electron microscopy of five putative contacts revealed symmetrical synapses between biocytin�filled presynaptic terminals and parvalbumin�immunoreactive postsynaptic dendrites (Fig. 2E, F). Since the axon collaterals were expected to contact several dendrites of the same cell, the dendritic arbors of several parvalbumin�immunoreactive neurons (n=10) were reconstructed from neighbouring sections. These reconstructions indicated that the biocytin�filled interneuron formed from one to seven putative contacts (median, 3) on the dendrites of a single parvalbumin�immunoreactive neuron (Fig. 2D). Typically, these contacts were on different dendrites, but two neighbouring boutons in contact with the same dendrite were also seen occasionally. On the basis of the median number of contacts per neuron and the total number of putative contacts on parvalbumin�immunoreactive dendrites, the filled neuron was estimated to innervate 400�450 parvalbumin cells. Similar estimates were not available for granule cells.

Each type of inhibitory neuron forms between 6-12 synapses with an individual principal cell and each elicits short-latency inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (i.p.s.ps), but with different dynamic characteristics.

3100399,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Despite the potential significance of the dentate hilus to memory function (Lisman, 1999) and epilepsy (Sloviter, 1987), little is known about the function of hilar interneurons or the properties of synapses formed by hilar neurons. The absence of functional information about the basic connectivity of the dentate hilus likely relates to both the absence of dense cell body layers (Amaral, 1978) and the frequent spontaneous synaptic responses hilar cells receive in both in vitro brain slices (Scharfman, 1993; Strowbridge and Schwartzkroin, 1996) and in vivo (Buckmaster et al., 1996). Spontaneous synaptic potentials in hilar neurons greatly increase the difficulty of identifying potential monosynaptic connections in this brain region. Responses to large numbers of precisely timed stimuli are required to verify that apparent postsynaptic responses do not reflect synchronous synaptic input or random coincidences of spontaneous events. The paired recordings in Figure 1B illustrate this problem. Putative evoked EPSPs (responses with onset latencies <3 ms, shown within circles) were greatly outnumbered by spontaneous EPSPs that are not correlated with mossy cell spikes. We used an automated post hoc procedure in this study to identify synaptic potentials in each record (see Materials and Methods) and visual inspection of spike-aligned response averages to circumvent this problem, enabling monosynaptic responses evoked between hilar neurons to be defined for the first time.<br> We tested for synaptic connections among 258 hilar neurons in 35 paired, 44 triple, and 14 quadruple simultaneous intracellular recordings in acute rat hippocampal slices. We recorded postsynaptic responses to presynaptic action potentials evoked by two-pulse stimuli (Fig. 1B2) in 502 potential hilar synaptic connections. Both individual event detection methods and average trace analysis (see Materials and Methods) identified the same 9 excitatory and 22 inhibitory synaptic connections, including the excitatory connection shown in Figure 1C (spike-aligned average response from the same paired recording shown in Fig. 1B2) and the inhibitory connection shown in the average postsynaptic response in Figure 1D. All recordings in this study were performed under current-clamp conditions to enable the intrinsic physiology of both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons to be assessed (see below) and to facilitate testing for multiple synaptic connections between groups of neurons within the same episode using staggered sets of current pulses.","p12214-5",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,19020015,0,"Ratios",NULL,"3200241.png",NULL
3100400,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"<b>ESTIMATING THE EXPECTED FREQUENCIES OF POLYSYNAPTIC CIRCUIT MOTIFS.</b><br> We estimated expected motif frequency by first multiplying the probabilities of each connection type, assuming independent connection probabilities, and then summing values from all simultaneous recordings to define the expected incidence of each motif (Song et al., 2005). Expected motif frequency was determined by dividing this number by the total number of each motif type that was possible in all simultaneously recorded groups of neurons. We determined the significance of our reciprocal and divergent circuit motifs using binomial cumulative distribution functions (Song et al., 2005) to determine the probability of finding a value larger than the number of observed motifs. For example, we found four reciprocal connections between mossy cells and hilar interneurons of 114 possible pairings of these two cell types, yielding a mossy cell/hilar interneuron reciprocal motif frequency of 3.5%. The constituent monosynaptic connection frequencies in this motif were 6.1% (7 observed mossy cell-to-interneuron connections of 114 possible) and 14.9% (17 observed interneuron-to-mossy cell connections of 114 possible). Given these monosynaptic connection probabilities, we expected reciprocal mossy cell/interneuron connections to occur with a frequency of 0.92% (1.0 expected in 114 pairings). We conclude that this reciprocal connection motif occurred more frequently than expected with a confidence level of p=0.021 (stated conservatively as p<0.05; binomial p=0.92%, n=114; likelihood of four or more motifs computed using binomial cumulative distribution).<br> We estimated the expected frequency of three- and four-cell motifs using Monte Carlo simulations (Press et al., 1992) to replicate the distributions of hilar cell type constellations recorded simultaneously in each experiment. Monosynaptic connections were assigned based on the connection frequencies (Fig. 4B) (e.g., 14.9% of mossy cell/interneuron simultaneous recordings were connected with an inhibitory synapse). Expected motif probabilities were estimated from the frequency that the motif occurred in 108 simulations using the Mersenne Twister random number generator. The Monte Carlo and binomial methods generated the same estimate of the expected frequency of mossy cell/interneuron reciprocal motifs.","p12214",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,19020015,0,"Ratios",NULL,"3100398.png",NULL

Both experimental data and simulations using fully reconstructed CA3 neurons labeled in vivo indicated that connectivity was only moderately dependent on slice orientation (materials and methods; fig. S3). However, connectivity may decline with distance (17). Furthermore, connectivity might be nonrandom, with ensembles of highly connected cells embedded in a sparsely connected population (18, 19). To test these hypotheses, we first examined whether the connection probability was dependent on intersomatic distance (Fig. 2A). The average connection probability did not significantly change with distance, for intersomatic distances of up to 400 �m (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, both EPSP and EPSC peak amplitudes were not significantly dependent on distance (fig. S4, A and B).<br>Next, we examined whether synaptic connectivity was random. To test this, we counted all disynaptic connectivity motifs (reciprocal connections, convergent triples, divergent triples, and disynaptic chains) in our experimental data set and compared motif numbers to those of a simulated data set assuming random connectivity and a connection probability of 0.92% (i.e., the experimental value; Fig. 2, B and C). All disynaptic connectivity motifs occurred significantly more frequently than expected by chance. The frequency of reciprocal connections, convergent triples, divergent triples, and disynaptic chains was 6.5-, 2.9-, 6.3-, and 3.4�fold higher, respectively, than the corresponding chance level (Fig. 2C; P?0.002 in all cases). Furthermore, we found several superconnectivity motifs (7 connections in one octuple, 10 and 3 connections in two septuples, and 3 connections in two quintuples), which were highly unlikely in random networks (Fig. 2D). As connection probability was not significantly dependent on intersomatic distance (Fig. 2A), the overabundance of motifs was not an epiphenomenon of distance dependence. Thus, connectivity in the CA3 cell network was not random, but highly enriched in connectivity motifs (17�19), reminiscent of a small�world network architecture (20). Both connection probability and abundance of motifs were similar in the range of ages tested (fig. S4, C and D). Comparison of properties of connections embedded in disynaptic motifs with those of isolated connections revealed that the EPSC peak amplitude was smaller and the proportion of failures was higher for embedded connections, whereas kinetic parameters were not significantly different (fig. S4E).","p1117",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,27609885,0,"CA3 Pyramidal?CA3 Pyramidal",NULL,NULL,NULL

However, differences were observed in the fine structural characteristics of the axon initial segments when compared with those obtained from perfusion�fixed brains. With increasing in vitro survival time the undercoating tended to diminish and the microtubule fascicles generally separated into individual microtubules.

None of the tested biocytin�filled boutons made synapses with any other target, i.e., somata or dendrites, even when these were in direct membrane apposition to the bouton. Some axo�axonic cells had rows of boutons in lower stratum radiatum in the CA1 area (Fig. 2A).

However, differences were observed in the fine structural characteristics of the axon initial segments when compared with those obtained from perfusion�fixed brains. With increasing in vitro survival time the undercoating tended to diminish and the microtubule fascicles generally separated into individual microtubules. From a total of nine cells 53 synapses were identified as forming axo�axonic synaptic junctions with axon initial segments. None of the tested biocytin�filled boutons made synapses with any other target, i.e., somata or dendrites, even when these were in direct membrane apposition to the bouton. Some axo�axonic cells had rows of boutons in lower stratum radiatum in the CA1 area (Fig. 2A). To establish their postsynaptic targets we serially sectioned one row from the axon shown in Fig. 2 and studied it with electron microscopy. The row of boutons followed an axon initial segment and three of the boutons could be shown to form synaptic junctions with it. Such initial segments probably belong to disoriented axons or they derive from ectopic pyramidal cells located in stratum radiatum. These findings confirm the notion that the output of axo�axonic cells is highly specific, and beyond, that their light microscopic features are sufficiently distinctive to permit their unequivocal identification. Therefore the remainder of eight cells was accepted without being scrutinized in the electron microscope.","p1293",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,8035215,0,"CA1 Axo�Axonic?CA1 Pyramidal;DG Axo�Axonic?DG Granule ",NULL,NULL,NULL

This suggested that these varicosities are indeed presynaptic boutons. To further corroborate this interpretation, their structure was examined at the EM level (n=8 cells; Fig. 10). OLM and SLM varicosities were easily identified by the dark DAB�reaction product in biocytin�filled (Fig. 10A; n=43) and EGFP�DAB�labeled varicosities (Fig. 10A2, B1, B2; n=63). In the majority of cases they were characterized by the presence of vesicles of various size, and formed connections with a clearly identifiable synaptic cleft and postsynaptic density (Fig. 10A2, B1, B2). In 91.8% of the varicosities in the OML and 93.2% in SLM an active zone (the structural equivalent for a functional transmitter release site) with the postsynaptic target structure was established (Fig. 10C1, C2) which further supports the functionality of these varicosities. In both layers, the majority of synaptic contacts originated from en passant axons and were established on dendritic shafts (?85%, n=100) of variable size (Fig. 10A1, A2, B2). Alternatively, they were found on spines (Fig. 10B1). This result suggests that CR cells target dentate gyrus granule cells in the OLM in addition to GABAergic interneurons and pyramidal cells in SLM (Quattrocolo and Maccaferri 2014).","p862-4",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,26582498,0,"CR cells?CA1:SLM|DG:SMo Dendrites|Spines",NULL,NULL,NULL

These trials included 134 cells that were held stably for tens of minutes, each of these being tested with up to 20 simultaneously, sequentially recorded pyramidal cells. All cells included in these totals had characteristics typical of CA1 pyramidal neurons. These were fully characterized in 38 of the longer�term recordings in which electrode characteristics permitted repeated large current injections and in which no connection was demonstrated. Spike amplitude was 89�3.8 mV (mean�S.D., range 81�94 mV), spike width at half�amplitude was between 0.4 and 0.7 ms, maximum input impedance was 32.9�11.3 M? (15�68 M?) and at the end of a 200�ms -2 nA pulse was always lower, i.e. 20.1�5.9 M? (10.4�38.0 M?); rebound depolarizations from large negative current pulses were 4.8�3.0 mV (1�12.2 mV) in amplitude and membrane time constants were 7.5�2.9 ms (5.4�18.2 ms). All cells included displayed similar properties, i.e. resting potentials between -60 and -75 mV, spike amplitudes greater than 80 mV (where spike width at half�amplitude was &lt;0.7 ms), spike accommodation and frequency adaptation, delayed inward rectification in response to large negative current pulses and a complex, typically triphasic spike afterhyperpolarization. The neurons reported here that were demonstrably involved in a synaptic connection displayed similar characteristics. No evidence could be found to suggest that they formed a distinct subset of pyramidal neurons (see Fig. 2B).

3100432,4038,NULL,4000,NULL,"From a total of 57 successfully recovered and identified stratum oriens horizontal interneurons, four were judged to be axo�axonic cells based on their axonal arborization. This was determined in an initial light microscopic analysis, giving them a �chandelier�-like appearance (Somogyi, 1977; Somogyi et al., 1985; Buhl et al., 1994) (Fig. 1A,E). Electron microscopic analysis of a random sample of the postsynaptic targets of two of these cells provided unequivocal evidence that this prediction was correct. The following discussion presents a detailed analysis of the properties of these cells. Some of the physiological features are summarized in Table 1.<br><b>Axonal and Dendritic Patterns; Synaptic Targets</b><br> All four cells presented in this report shared the main anatomical feature of a characteristic axonal arbor located primarily in the part of stratum pyramidale adjoining stratum oriens and also in stratum oriens itself (Fig. 1A,E). For two of the cells (cell 240499 and 080299), some bouton�bearing axon collaterals also spread into the deep stratum oriens and alveus. Only a few collaterals penetrated the compact layer of stratum pyramidale and stratum radiatum, but when they did, they established radially oriented rows of boutons, the hallmark of axo�axonic cells (Fig. 1A,E). Because of the truncation of axonal trees by the slicing procedure, no attempt was made to count the rows of boutons here. The main axons of horizontal axo�axonic cells originated in the soma in three cases and from a very proximal dendrite in one case.<br>Electron microscopic analysis of a random sample of 10 postsynaptic targets for each of cell 081298 and 080299 showed that they made synapses exclusively on axon initial segments. Even when the identified bouton was in direct membrane apposition to the cell body of a pyramidal cell, it made no synaptic junction with it, but formed a junction with a nearby AIS. The AIS were recognized by their higher electron opacity than that of dendrites in the same material, and, when present, the electron�dense membrane undercoating, microtubule fascicles, and a high density of membranous tubules and large vesicles (Fig. 1F). They only received type II synapses both from the recorded axo�axonic cell and from unlabeled boutons, presumably originating in other converging axoaxonic cells (Fig. 1F). These axon initial segments very likely originate in CA1 pyramidal cells, although only three could be followed back to the parent cells within the examined series of sections. The axons did not form appositions with the axon initial segment, soma, or dendrite of the labeled interneurons themselves; therefore, there was no indication of autaptic contacts (Cobb et al., 1997). The axon initial segment of interneurons examined in the rodent hippocampus so far received no synapses, or very few (P. Somogyi, unpublished observation).<br>The soma of all four cells was spindle shaped, elongated parallel with the layers (called the horizontal orientation), with short and long axes of ~10 and 20 �m, respectively. Three of the somata were located in stratum oriens about halfway between the stratum pyramidale and the alveus (Fig. 1A�C); one was closer to the alveus. The recovery of three of the cells was excellent, and we were able to trace dendrites to their apparent natural ends. One of the cells showed signs of collapse, and the dendrites were filled with HRP reaction product only in patches. Nevertheless, some could be traced up to a 200��m distance, and it is unlikely that any major dendrite was missed. Most dendrites emanated from the two poles of the soma and ran parallel with the pyramidal cell layer. Branching occurred mainly at the origin of dendrites and in their most distal parts. The dendrites showing natural ends could be traced for up to ~340 �m from the soma, making a total lateral dendritic extent of 400�500 �m. The dendrites were mostly smooth, with a few filopodial extensions, as is typical in young animals, and with a low density of drumstick�shaped spines on two of the cells. Some dendrites emanated from the sides or upper parts of the soma and were truncated by the slicing procedure. We cannot exclude the possibility that some of the truncated dendrites extended into layers outside the stratum oriens, but this was observed only in one of the cells (cell 240499), which had a small dendrite reaching the lower part of stratum radiatum.","p234-5",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,15098728,0,"Mo; CA1 Horizontal Axo-Axonic?CA1 Pyramidal",NULL,NULL,NULL

3100440,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"<b>Light and electron microscopic classification of R�LM interneurons</b><br>Light microscopic examination revealed that those R�LM interneurons with extensive dendritic and axonal labelling (n=22) could be incorporated into at least four distinct, non�overlapping categories. Prominent differences were apparent with regard to the lamination pattern of the axon, innervating circumscribed hippocampal layers and/or showing a highly distinct arborization pattern. In those instances, when the axon appeared to be co�laminated with a major glutamatergic hippocampal afferent pathway, such as the perforant pathway, we have followed the terminology originally proposed for dentate gyrus local�circuit neurons (Han et al. 1993), which has found relatively widespread acceptance and has been extended to other hippocampal subfields (for review see Freund &amp; Buzs�ki, 1996).<br><b>(1)</b> The axon of R�LM basket cells (n=4) was confined to the somatic region and adjoining parts of strata radiatum and oriens (Fig. 1A).<br><b>(2)</b> The most abundant type of interneuron, the Schaffer collateral/commissural pathway�associated interneurons (n=10), for reasons of brevity referred to as Schaffer�associated interneurons, predominantly innervated stratum radiatum and, to a lesser extent, stratum oriens (Figs 2A and ?and3A).3A).<br><b>(3)</b> The axon of perforant path�associated interneurons (n=6) was concentrated in stratum lacunosum�moleculare of the CA1 area and could also extend into the molecular layer of both dentate gyrus and subiculum (Fig. 5A).<br><b>(4)</b> The remaining class of local�circuit neuron had a very small stellate dendritic tree and an equally compact axonal arbour within strata radiatum and lacunosum�moleculare (Figs 6A and ?and7).7). Based on their striking resemblance to a class of previously described neocortical non�principal cells (Szent�gothai, 1973) we have thus adopted the term neurogliaform interneurons (n=2).<br>Regarding the efferent connectivity of hippocampal interneurons, the laminar distribution of axonal arbours is already a reasonably good predictor for their postsynaptic domain specificity (Guly�s et al. 1993; Halasy &amp; Somogyi, 1993). However, light microscopic predictions are nevertheless insufficient to assess adequately the postsynaptic target preference for particular membrane domains which may overlap within a given lamina, such as, for example, somata, dendrites and axon initial segments being co�distributed within the pyramidal cell layer. Within the strata radiatum and lacunosum�moleculare potential postsynaptic targets include pyramidal dendrites and spines, the somata of occasional pyramidal cells and the entire somato�dendritic surface of other interneurons. We therefore studied the postsynaptic target distribution of a representative sample of R�LM interneurons (n=14; Table 2), using random electron microscopic sampling of vesicle�containing axonal boutons (n=231), 164 of which were found to establish a total of 170 synaptic junctions (Fig. 8A�K; Table 2). Overall, these data indicate that postsynaptic target profiles are relatively stereotyped within the respective groups (see below), notwithstanding some degree of variability, which may be partially due to the limited sample size (10�17 synaptic junctions per cell). Importantly, all cells appeared to favour pyramidal cells as their postsynaptic targets and it is therefore highly probable that none of the cell classes described below overlaps with those categories of R�LM interneurons which have been recently shown to target predominantly, if not exclusively, other interneurons (Guly�s et al. 1996; Acs�dy et al. 1996).","p761",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,9503336,0,"CA1 R-LM",NULL,NULL,NULL

The Up states are generated by a recurrent interaction between PYR neurons and FS interneurons, with less involvement of ST and SOM neurons. The FS interneurons also project to one another, regulating their response to the excitatory potentials initiated by PYR and ST neurons. Nearby NPY interneurons are also depolarized by activity in excitatory and inhibitory FS neurons, but this does not reach action potential threshold. SOM interneurons receive mild excitatory inputs, which occasionally bring the cell to discharge. In contrast, both 5HTR3a and VIP interneurons receive relatively little synaptic input, despite the strong action potential barrages in nearby PYR and FS neurons. The arrows with different thickness indicate the relative strength of the functional connections between pyramidal/stellate neurons, FS interneurons, and the other subtypes of interneurons recorded. These results reveal a remarkable specificity and heterogeneity in the interconnections of pyramidal cells and different subtypes of inhibitory interneurons in the cerebral cortex.","Fig. 10",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,22933799,0,"(SC??PC)??(FS-IN??FS-IN)??NPY+|SOM+|5HTR3A+|VIP+??(SC??PC)",NULL,"3100463.png",NULL

3100472,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Spine�free calretinin�immunoreactive (CR�IR) interneurons form a subpopulation of GABAergic cells in the rat hippocampus. A characteristic feature of these cells--located in all areas and layers--is the frequent dendro�dendritic and axo�dendritic contacts they form with each other. In this study we examined in detail the connectivity of these neurons by reconstructing their dendritic and axonal arbor and by identifying their postsynaptic targets. Radially running dendrites of CR�IR cells, located in different layers, intermingled into long braids. An average cell was in contact with dendrites of three to seven other CR�IR cells. Reconstruction of the dendritic trees from six consecutive sections demonstrated that at least 15 cells may participate in a dendro�dendritically connected cluster. Electron microscopical examination revealed that regularly spaced zonula adherentia connect the touching dendrites. The postsynaptic targets of CR�IR neurons have been examined using postembedding immunogold staining for GABA. CR�containing GABA�immunoreactive axons of local origin formed multiple symmetrical synaptic contacts (two to five) exclusively on GABAergic dendrites (CR�negative as well as CR�positive). Two to 10 CR�IR axons may converge onto a single CR�IR neuron, often from cells belonging to the same dendro�dendritically connected cluster. Using double immunocytochemistry, CR�IR cells were shown to heavily innervate calbindin D28k�containing interneurons and VIP�containing basket cells but avoided the parvalbumin�containing basket and axo�axonic cells. The unique connectivity of CR�IR cells may enable them to play a crucial role in the generation of synchronous, rhythmic hippocampal activity by controlling other interneurons terminating on different dendritic and somatic compartments of principal cells.","Abstract",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,8627375,0,"exclusively on GABAergic dendrites; avoid PV+ basket and axo-axonic cells",NULL,NULL,NULL
