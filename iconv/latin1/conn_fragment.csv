This two-layered axonal arrangement gives the cell its name. Bistratified cells make GABAergic synapses with basal and oblique dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells (Buhl et al., 1994; Maccaferri et al., 2000; Pawelzik et al., 2002; Klausberger et al., 2004). Their somata are mainly located in stratum pyramidale, but oriens-bistratified cells with somata and horizontally running dendrites in stratum oriens have also been reported (Maccaferri et al., 2000). The dendrites of bistratified cells in stratum pyramidale extend widely in the strata oriens and radiatum and form connexin36-containing gap junctions with other interneurons (Baude et al., 2007). In contrast to basket and axo-axonic cells, the dendrites of bistratified cells do not enter stratum lacunosum-moleculare but often bend back at the radiatum/lacunosum-moleculare border (Fig. 2A).","p949, left upper",Klausberger T,GABAergic interneurons targeting dendrites of pyramidal cells in the CA1 area of the hippocampus,European Journal of Neuroscience,2009,19735288,,,,

Most of the synaptic terminals of the associational/commissural pathway form asymmetrical, presumably excitatory synaptic terminals on the spines of proximal dendrites of granule cells.

Remembering that mossy cells are the recipients of massive innervation from the granule cells at their same level (via the mossy fiber collaterals into the polymorphic layer), it appears that the mossy cells pass on the collective output of granule cells from one septotemporal level to granule cells located at distant levels of the dentate gyrus.","p63, right middle","Amaral D, Lavenex P",Hippocampal Neuroanatomy,The Hippocampus Book,2026,978-0-19-510027-3,,,,

The PP input from the EC to CA1 (also referred to as the temporo-ammonic path) selectivdy innervates the distal apical dendrites in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (Blackstad, 1958). Some of the PP fibers forming synapses on CA1 pyramidal neurons reach their targets in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare via the temporo-alvear pathway (Deller et al., 1996a).""",p137 right middle,"Spruston N, McBain C",Structual and Functional Properties of Hippocampal Neurons,The Hippocampus Book,2007,978-0-19-510027-3,,,,

While the extent of the dendrites is restricted along the septo-temporal axis (<500pim), the axon can cover 53-61% of the hippocampus (Buckmaster et al., 1996). Thus, mossy cells provide a distributed excitatory feedback to the DG [Dentate gyrus]. The ipsilateral length of the axon is between 73 and 96 mm (uncorrected two-dimensional projection, Buckmaster et al., 1996). Most of the axon is in the inner molecular layer (53-56%) and the hilus (23-27%) but collaterals are also found in the granule cell layer, the middle molecular layer, the CA3, and occasionally also in the CA1 (Buckmaster et al., 1996). In the molecular layer, the axon forms synapses every ~2 microm and the large majority of the postsynaptic targets are dendritic spines of GCs [granule cells] (Buckmaster et al., 1996). While numerically low, synaptic contacts onto interneurons have been suggested to play an important role in regulating the excitability of the DG (Ratzliff et al., 2002; Sloviter et al., 2003).",p40 middle,Vida I,Morphology of Hippocampal Neurons,Hippocampal Microcircuits,2010,978-1-4419-0995-4,,,,

The somatodendritic morphology is reminiscent of pyramidal cells. The large triangular or ovoid soma is located in the granule cell layer, often at the border to the hilus. Apical dendrites extend into the molecular layer and can receive input from all major afferent pathways. Basal dendrites are found in the hilus and receive recurrent excitatory input from mossy fibers mediated by multiple, 2-4 distributed contacts (Geiger et al., 1997).",p56 middle,Vida I,Morphology of Hippocampal Neurons,Hippocampal Microcircuits,2010,978-1-4419-0995-4,,,,

1006020,CA3c Pyr,GC,"All CA3c neurons in this study sent axon collaterals into the hilus proper (zone 4). In addition, the present report provides direct evidence for the existence of a feedback projection of CA3c neurons to granule cells. Although this projection in the dorsal hippocampus may not be very powerful, in the ventral hippocampus it must play a significant role in the physiological processing of incoming information. In the dorsal hippocampus only one out of seven CA3c/zone 3 cells had axons that penetrated through the granule cell layer and terminated in the inner third of the molecular layer. The neuron (R82) was located at the proximal end of the CA3c pyramidal layer and all other labeled neurons were distal to it. In the ventral hippocampus, 3 out of 3 CA3 pyramidal cells {CA3c CA3c (e)03223p (000S0) Pyramidal} had extensive projections to the inner molecular layer. One of them (R60) was near the border of CA3c/Ca3b and had a moderate amount of axon collaterals in the suprapyramidal molecular layer. The other two neurons (R32 pair) were located close to the proximal end of CA3c. These cells projected to both the suprapyramidal and infrapyramidal parts of the molecular layer. The density of axons in the inner molecular layer was very high and in fact denser than the axon collaterals of intracellularly labeled ""mossy"" cells in vivo (Soltesz and Deschenes, '92).","p204, right middle","Li XG, Somogyi P, Ylinen A, Buzsaki G",The hippocampal CA3 network: an in vivo intracellular labeling study.,J Comp Neurol,1994,8300905,,,,

In a recent study SPR was found to be present in all PV[parvalbumin]- and CCK[cholecystokinin]-positive cells of the strata granulosum and moleculare, and in a large number of GABA[gamma aminobutyric acid]-ergic neurons of the hilus (in the somatostatin-, CR[calretinin]- and CCK- containing subpopulations), while mossy cells were not labelled by SPR (Acsady et al., 1995b). The dendrites of spiny SPR-positive cells, and some aspiny neurons as well, give rise to a profuse dendritic arbour in the hilus (Nakaya et al., 1994; Acsady et al.,1995b) which perfectly overlaps with the VIP-positive hilar axonal plexus. VIP-SPR double-immunostaining showed that the main targets of hilar VIP-positive boutons are indeed the SPR-positive spiny and aspiny cells.

Numerous small dendritic branches, many of them reaching the ventricular surface of the hippocampus, were found among the axons of the alveus.

The other dendrite descending in the stratum radiatum also reached the stratum lacunosum-moleculare with its thin terminal branches.

Typically, these neurons possessed a single axon that crossed stratum pyramidale, although some neurons had minor axon collaterals that terminated either in stratum radiatum and/or stratum oriens (see Fig. 4B). The dendrites of these cells were oriented parallel to stratum oriens and confined exclusively to this layer.

They found that injections into the CA1 cell layer (including the proximal apical and basal dendrites) resulted in anterograde (CA1 to subiculum) label and retrograde (subiculum to CA1) label in subiculum. Injections of tritiated proline or leucine into subiculum showed anterograde label in CA1 stratum oriens (much of this interpreted as fibers headed for the alveus/fimbria) and label in CA1 stratum moleculare (ended at CA2). Finch et al. [8] [1983] traced the dendrites and axons of intracellularly labeled subicular neurons in rat brains. They reported on 12 labeled subicular neurons. Of this group of 12 labeled neurons, four projected only rostrally into the fimbria and three others had both rostrally and caudally directed projections. One of these cells {SUB SUB CA1-Projecting Pyramidal} had collaterals in subiculum with an identified collateral reaching stratum oriens of CA1. Kohler [14] [1985] used extracellular phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) injections into subiculum to trace the region's outputs. Although not discussed at length in the paper, labeled fibers are apparent in CA1 strata oriens and moleculare. It was suggested that at least some of the fibers seen in stratum oriens were actually headed for the alveus rather than directed at CA1. It was also suggested that the projections to stratum moleculare may be directed at distal apical interneurons rather than pyramidal cell dendrites. On the basis of our morphological data and attempts to block propagation by disrupting laminar paths, we conclude that the subicular fibers forming the back projection are present in the apical dendritic region and in the vicinity of the cell layer. We have visualized axons with light microscopic evidence of contacts in stratum radiatum reaching to its border with stratum lacunosum/moleculare, and axons in the cell layer. Our evidence that at least a fraction of these contacts are onto pyramidal neurons comes from the electrophysiological evidence that they mediate the spread of epileptiform events.","p48, left top","Harris E, Stewart M",Propagation of synchronous epileptiform events from subiculum backward into area CA1 of rat brain slices.,Brain Res,2001,11259758,,,,

Several approaches established that hilar neurons could be activated readily, but granule cells could not.
First, fimbria stimulation was used to activate CA3 pyramidal cells instead of the hilus, because antidromic action potentials are easily elicited in CA3 neurons by stimulation at this site, with no evidence for direct activation of hilar neurons and granule cells. Direct activation would be expected because hilar cells that project commissurally have an axon that descends into stratum oriens of CA3b, presumably on its way to the fimbria, but in our slices, we have found that it is severed before reaching the fimbria. Direct activation of granule cells would only be possible if current spread entered stratum lucidum, which recordings show does not occur after fimbria stimulation using the methods we have employed.
Extracellular recordings showed that such fimbria stimulation led to antidromic and orthodromic activation of CA3 b and c pyramidal cells, followed by an extracellular negative wave in the granule cell layer and inner molecular layer that reversed polarity in the middle molecular layer (Fig. 2). Due to the negative resting potential of granule cells, the negative potential could reflect an EPSP or depolarized IPSP, and it was shown subsequently by intracellular recording that it was a depolarized GABAA receptor-mediated IPSP (Fig. 3; Scharfman, 1994a, Scharfman, 1994b and Scharfman, 1994c).
This fimbria stimulation site activated hilar mossy cells and hilar GABAergic neurons disynaptically, and was sensitive to the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX but not the muscarinic antagonist atropine (Scharfman, 1993a). At a longer latency, the granule cell IPSP began. These data suggesting that fimbria activation of CA3 pyramidal cells led to hilar neuron activation, presumably by hilar collaterals of CA3 pyramidal cells. Comparing the latency to the response of CA3 pyramidal cells and hilar cells supported this hypothesis, because CA3 pyramidal cells were activated at short latency and hilar cells approximately 2 ms later. The same stimulus evoked a long latency IPSP in granule cells, consistent with a CA3-hilar neuron-granule cell pathway. In the presence of bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist, fimbria stimulation evoked EPSPs in granule cells, and did so with a similar latency as the IPSPs, suggesting a CA3-mossy cell-granule cell pathway is normally masked by the activation of GABAergic interneurons by CA3 hilar collaterals (Fig. 3). Additional studies revealed that the GABAergic neurons may not only involve those in the hilus, but also the Òbasket cellsÓ of the granule cell layer (Scharfman, 1994a and Scharfman, 1994c; Kneisler and Dingledine, 1995).",p630 right,Scharfman HE,"The CA3 ""backprojection"" to the dentate gyrus",Prog Brain Res,2007,17765742,,,,

There was a relatively high probability of finding a recurrent connection between pairs of pyramidal neurons in both layer V (around 12%) and layer III (around 9%). In complete contrast, we have failed to find any recurrent synaptic connections between principal neurons in layer II, and this may be an important factor in the relative resistance of this layer in generating synchronized epileptiform activity. In general, recurrent excitatory postsynaptic potentials in layers III and V of the entorhinal cortex had similar properties to those recorded in other cortical areas, although the probabilities of connection are among the highest reported. Recurrent excitatory postsynaptic potentials recorded in layer V were smaller with faster rise times than those recorded in layer III. In both layers, the recurrent potentials were mediated by glutamate primarily acting at _-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole receptors, although there appeared to be a slow component mediated by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. In layer III, recurrent transmission failed on about 30% of presynaptic action potentials evoked at 0.2 Hz. This failure rate increased markedly with increasing (2, 3 Hz) frequency of activation. In layer V the failure rate at low frequency was less (19%), and although it increased at higher frequencies this effect was less pronounced than in layer III.

We selected INs with the cell body in stratum oriens and confirmed IN identity based on the firing pattern and morphology (n = 10; Fig. 5A).

Aside from the 39% of synapses made onto other pyramidal cells and the 54% made onto interneurons, there are an additional 7% of local synapses made onto unknown targets (Takacs et al., 2012).

(ii) A pyramidal-shaped neuron with a cell body located in the subgranular layer innervated mostly the inner molecular layer and the granule cell layer (hilar interneuron with commissural-associational pathway-associated axon terminals; HICAP cell). It contacted both granule cells and interneurons. Axon collaterals of HIPP and HICAP neurons covered virtually the entire septo-temporal extent of the dorsal dentate gyrus. (iii) Calbindin-immunoreactive neurons with horizontal dendrites in stratum oriens of the CA3c region gave rise to a rich axon arbor in strata oriens, pyramidale and radiatum and innervated almost the entire extent of the dorsal hippocampus, with some collaterals entering the subicular area (putative trilaminar cell). (iv) Hilar basket cells innervated mostly the granule cell layer and to some extent the inner molecular layer and the CA3c pyramidal layer. HIPP and trilaminar interneurons could be antidromically activated by stimulation of the fimbria. Only the HICAP cells could be monosynaptically discharged by the perforant path input.

The axon of the pyramidal cell formed 15 295 boutons, 63.8% of which were in stratum oriens, 15.4% in stratum pyramidale and 20.8% in stratum radiatum. Only 2.1% of the axon terminals contacted parvalbumin-positive neurons. Most of these were single contacts (84.7%), but double or triple contacts (15.3%) were also found. The majority of the boutons terminated on dendrites (84.1%) of parvalbumin-positive cells, less frequently on cell bodies (15.9%). In order to estimate the proportion of contacts representing synapses, 16 light microscopically identified contacts between boutons of the filled pyramidal cell axon and the parvalbumin-positive targets were examined by correlated electron microscopy. Thirteen of them were found to be asymmetrical synapses, and in the remaining three cases synapses between the labelled profiles could not be confirmed.

Using immunohistochemistry and viral tracing, we examined whether the newly defined CA2 pyramidal cells lacked mossy fiber innervation, another classical criterion of CA2 cells8, 9. To our surprise, we found that calbindin-positive mossy fibers24 projected extensively to PCP4-positive CA2 neurons in the stratum lucidum (the percentage of PCP4-positive cells overlapping with mossy fibers was 82.2 ± 1.1%, that of cells not overlapping with mossy fibers was 17.8 ± 1.1%, n = 5 mice; Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). Next, we examined the distribution of ZnT3 (ref. 25), a presynaptic vesicle marker of mossy fibers, and VGluT1, a glutamatergic presynaptic vesicle marker, in the stratum lucidum of CA2. We found that ZnT3 and VGluT1 double-positive presynaptic clusters were located on RGS14-positive dendrites (Fig. 2c,d). Furthermore, we found that ZnT3 clusters overlapped with a postsynaptic marker, PSD95, on RGS14-positive dendrites (Fig. 2eÐh). These data suggest that, contrary to the classical definition8, 9, mossy fibers form synaptic contacts with CA2 pyramidal neurons. We examined the morphology of mossy fiber terminals by infecting dentate gyrus with HSV mini-Enk promoterÐChETAÐyellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (Fig. 2i) and found that CA2 received small mossy fiber boutons in contrast to the giant mossy fiber boutons received by CA39 (average bouton diameters: CA2, 0.97 ± 0.05 _m, n = 60 boutons; CA3, 2.11 ± 0.1 _m, n = 43 boutons; from n = 5 mice, Kolmogorov Smirnov P < 0.001; Fig. 2jÐl).",p270-271,"Kohara K, Pignatelli M, Rivest AJ, Jung HY, Kitamura T, Suh J, Frank D, Kajikawa K, Mise N, Obata Y, Wickersham IR, Tonegawa S.",Cell type-specific genetic and optogenetic tools reveal hippocampal CA2 circuits,Nat Neurosci,2014,24336151,,,,

These neurons (n =4) usually had somata located within the deep hilus, 20-50 [micro]m beneath the granule cell layer, and were fusiform in shape, with two- to four thick smooth primary dendrites emerging from the two poles of the soma. After a short distance, these primary dendrites give rise to several secondary and tertiary branches, which either remain within the hilus or terminate in the granule cell layer or molecular layer, sometimes ending in a small terminal tuft (Fig. 8B). The characteristic feature of these neurons is their axonal projection terminating in the outer molecular layer in a particular vertically oriented fashion (Fig. 8B). The main axon emerges from either the soma or one of the primary dendrites (Fig. 8B). Shortly after leaving the soma, the axon gives off several very long axonal collaterals ( <% 900 [micro]m) [less than or equal to 900 microm]. One population then takes a more or less vertical course passing through the granule cell layer, the inner molecular layer, and finally terminating within the outer molecular layer. Within the inner molecular layer, some of these collaterals give rise to tangentially oriented side branches of variable length (30-300 [micro]m) that also terminate within the outer molecular layer. On their way through the granule cell layer, these vertically oriented axonal collaterals form basket-like bouton arrays around granule cell somata. A second population of collaterals establishes a sometimes dense axonal plexus within the hilus, with en passant boutons contacting somata of other hilar neurons.

Slices were maintained at the interface between artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing (in mM): 126 $Cl, 3 $Cl, 1.25 NaH 2 P0 4 , 24 NaHC0 3 , 2 MgS0 4, 2 CaCI 2 , 10 glucose, pH 7.2, and a humidified atmosphere of 95% 0 2 and 5% C0 2 , at 34-35 C. Sharp glass microelectrodes contained 2% biocytin in 1.5 M potassium methylsulphate and were bevelled to a d.c. resistance of 60-150 MQ. Recovered biocytin-labelled cells were analysed in the light microscope and target selectivity was determined by electron microscopy for a total of 94 basket cell and 22 axo-axonic cell synaptic contacts, ranging from 6 to 24 contacts per cell. All values are expressed as means  s.d.

The total number of mossy terminals along the main axon in the CA3 region varied from 10 to 18 (average, 12.3  0.9).

3100055,,,"Paired intracellular recordings were used to investigate recurrent excitatory transmission in layers II, III and V of the rat entorhinal cortex in vitro. There was a relatively high probability of finding a recurrent connection between pairs of pyramidal neurons in both layer V (around 12%) and layer III (around 9%). In complete contrast, we have failed to find any recurrent synaptic connections between principal neurons in layer II, and this may be an important factor in the relative resistance of this layer in generating synchronized epileptiform activity. In general, recurrent excitatory postsynaptic potentials in layers III and V of the entorhinal cortex had similar properties to those recorded in other cortical areas, although the probabilities of connection are among the highest reported. Recurrent excitatory postsynaptic potentials recorded in layer V were smaller with faster rise times than those recorded in layer III. In both layers, the recurrent potentials were mediated by glutamate primarily acting at ?-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole receptors, although there appeared to be a slow component mediated by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. In layer III, recurrent transmission failed on about 30% of presynaptic action potentials evoked at 0.2 Hz. This failure rate increased markedly with increasing (2, 3 Hz) frequency of activation. In layer V the failure rate at low frequency was less (19%), and although it increased at higher frequencies this effect was less pronounced than in layer III. Finally, in layer III, there was evidence for a relatively high probability of electrical coupling between pyramidal neurons.",Abstract,,,,,11029534,EC:II (+) Stellate??EC:II (+) Stellate; MEC:V (+) neuron??MEC:V (+) neuron,,,2000045

We selected INs with the cell body in stratum oriens and confirmed IN identity based on the firing pattern and morphology (n = 10; Fig. 5A).

The paired-pulse ratio of AMPAR-mediated eEPSCs was similar in GluN2B?GAD67 and control neurons (n.s., MannWhitney test; Fig. 5D,G), supporting that the observed amplitude changes reflect postsynaptic alterations.

3100220,,,"Evidence for subicular inputs to CA1 has appeared in several previous anatomical studies. Berger et al. [5] [1980] examined the anterograde and retrograde transport of HRP [horseradish peroxidase] in rabbit brains. They found that injections into the CA1 cell layer (including the proximal apical and basal dendrites) resulted in anterograde (CA1 to subiculum) label and retrograde (subiculum to CA1) label in subiculum. Injections of tritiated proline or leucine into subiculum showed anterograde label in CA1 stratum oriens (much of this interpreted as fibers headed for the alveus/fimbria) and label in CA1 stratum moleculare (ended at CA2). Finch et al. [8] [1983] traced the dendrites and axons of intracellularly labeled subicular neurons in rat brains. They reported on 12 labeled subicular neurons. Of this group of 12 labeled neurons, four projected only rostrally into the fimbria and three others had both rostrally and caudally directed projections. One of these cells {SUB SUB CA1-Projecting Pyramidal} had collaterals in subiculum with an identified collateral reaching stratum oriens of CA1. Kohler [14] [1985] used extracellular phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) injections into subiculum to trace the region's outputs. Although not discussed at length in the paper, labeled fibers are apparent in CA1 strata oriens and moleculare. It was suggested that at least some of the fibers seen in stratum oriens were actually headed for the alveus rather than directed at CA1. It was also suggested that the projections to stratum moleculare may be directed at distal apical interneurons rather than pyramidal cell dendrites. On the basis of our morphological data and attempts to block propagation by disrupting laminar paths, we conclude that the subicular fibers forming the back projection are present in the apical dendritic region and in the vicinity of the cell layer. We have visualized axons with light microscopic evidence of contacts in stratum radiatum reaching to its border with stratum lacunosum/moleculare, and axons in the cell layer. Our evidence that at least a fraction of these contacts are onto pyramidal neurons comes from the electrophysiological evidence that they mediate the spread of epileptiform events.",p48,,,,,11259758,SUB CA1-Proj Pyr?CA1 Pyr,,,1007168

The other dendrite descending in the stratum radiatum also reached the stratum lacunosum-moleculare with its thin terminal branches. However, as the dendrite coursed temporally, it falsely appears to terminate in the stratum radiatum (Fig. 1 A) due to the curvature of the laminar boundaries in three dimensions which could not be represented in a two dimensional reconstruction.

Several approaches established that hilar neurons could be activated readily, but granule cells could not.First, fimbria stimulation was used to activate CA3 pyramidal cells instead of the hilus, because antidromic action potentials are easily elicited in CA3 neurons by stimulation at this site, with no evidence for direct activation of hilar neurons and granule cells. Direct activation would be expected because hilar cells that project commissurally have an axon that descends into stratum oriens of CA3b, presumably on its way to the fimbria, but in our slices, we have found that it is severed before reaching the fimbria. Direct activation of granule cells would only be possible if current spread entered stratum lucidum, which recordings show does not occur after fimbria stimulation using the methods we have employed.Extracellular recordings showed that such fimbria stimulation led to antidromic and orthodromic activation of CA3 b and c pyramidal cells, followed by an extracellular negative wave in the granule cell layer and inner molecular layer that reversed polarity in the middle molecular layer (Fig. 2). Due to the negative resting potential of granule cells, the negative potential could reflect an EPSP or depolarized IPSP, and it was shown subsequently by intracellular recording that it was a depolarized GABAA receptor-mediated IPSP (Fig. 3; Scharfman, 1994a, Scharfman, 1994b and Scharfman, 1994c).This fimbria stimulation site activated hilar mossy cells and hilar GABAergic neurons disynaptically, and was sensitive to the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX but not the muscarinic antagonist atropine (Scharfman, 1993a). At a longer latency, the granule cell IPSP began. These data suggesting that fimbria activation of CA3 pyramidal cells led to hilar neuron activation, presumably by hilar collaterals of CA3 pyramidal cells. Comparing the latency to the response of CA3 pyramidal cells and hilar cells supported this hypothesis, because CA3 pyramidal cells were activated at short latency and hilar cells approximately 2 ms later. The same stimulus evoked a long latency IPSP in granule cells, consistent with a CA3-hilar neuron-granule cell pathway. In the presence of bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist, fimbria stimulation evoked EPSPs in granule cells, and did so with a similar latency as the IPSPs, suggesting a CA3-mossy cell-granule cell pathway is normally masked by the activation of GABAergic interneurons by CA3 hilar collaterals (Fig. 3).

These two subgroups were differently connected to stellate cells: 43 putative fast-spiking interneurons (resting membrane voltage (Vm) = 68.8 mV  3 mV; non-adapting: action potential halfwidth, 0.6 ms  0.09 ms) made abundant inhibitory synapses onto 24 stellate cells (54% connectivity rate; peak latency = 10.27 ms  0.5 ms; Fig. 3a,b23), whereas we found no connections from 10 low-threshold spiking (LTS) putative interneurons (rest Vm = 56 mV  4 mV; adapting; action potential halfwidth, 0.9 ms  0.08 ms).

The smooth apical dendrite crossed the granule cell layer and bifurcated in the inner molecular layer. Most of the dendritic branches were in the outer third of the molecular layer. The basal dendritic branches remained in the hilus and were covered sparsely with spines (Fig. 5). The principal axon originated from the soma, which gave off several main collaterals that penetrated the granule cell layer. Most axon collaterals coursed in the inner third of the molecular layer (75.5%). However, a significant portion of the axon collaterals (22.6%) remained in the granule cell layer (Fig. 4). Finally, a very small proportion of the collaterals contacted neurons in the hilus proper (Figs 4 and 5C, D).

In the septo-temporal axis, the axon collaterals spanned most of the dorsal dentate gyms (2.58 mm), although the density of collaterals decreased both septally and temporally from the cell body (Fig. 4).

The number of putative contacts was multiplied by the ratio of the total axon length and the axon length in the selected sections to estimate the total number of synaptic contacts on parvalbumin-immunoreactive dendrites (n = 1355 contacts). Electron microscopy of five putative contacts revealed symmetrical synapses between biocytin-filled presynaptic terminals and parvalbumin-immunoreactive postsynaptic dendrites (Fig. 2E, F). Since the axon collaterals were expected to contact several dendrites of the same cell, the dendritic arbors of several parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons (n = 10) were reconstructed from neighboring sections. These reconstructions indicated that the biocytin-filled interneuron formed from one to seven putative contacts (median, 3) on the dendrites of a single parvalbumin-immunoreactive neuron (Fig. 2D). Typically, these contacts were on different dendrites, but two neighboring boutons in contact with the same dendrite were also seen occasionally. On the basis of the median number of contacts per neuron and the total number of putative contacts on parvalbumin-immunoreactive dendrites, the filled neuron was estimated to innervate 400-450 parvalbumin cells. Similar estimates were not available for granule cells.

The number of putative contacts was multiplied by the ratio of the total axon length and the axon length in the selected sections to estimate the total number of synaptic contacts on parvalbumin-immunoreactive dendrites (n = 1355 contacts). Electron microscopy of five putative contacts revealed symmetrical synapses between biocytin-filled presynaptic terminals and parvalbumin-immunoreactive postsynaptic dendrites (Fig. 2E, F). Since the axon collaterals were expected to contact several dendrites of the same cell, the dendritic arbors of several parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons (n = 10) were reconstructed from neighboring sections. These reconstructions indicated that the biocytin-filled interneuron formed from one to seven putative contacts (median, 3) on the dendrites of a single parvalbumin-immunoreactive neuron (Fig. 2D). Typically, these contacts were on different dendrites, but two neighboring boutons in contact with the same dendrite were also seen occasionally. On the basis of the median number of contacts per neuron and the total number of putative contacts on parvalbumin-immunoreactive dendrites, the filled neuron was estimated to innervate 400-450 parvalbumin cells. Similar estimates were not available for granule cells. However, since there were 6000-10000 boutons in an 80 m section (Fig. 1B), which contains 8000 granule cells (Seress and Pokorny, 1981; Amaral et al., 1990), it is likely that granule cells are innervated by multiple release sites.

Mossy cells were recorded simultaneously with their potential targets, granule cells and interneurons. The ?aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor antagonist <i>bicuculline</i> was used in most experiments to block the normally strong inhibitory inputs to granule cells that could mask excitatory effects of mossy cells. Some cells were recorded with electrodes containing the marker Neurobiotin so that their identity could be confirmed morphologically. <br>  <b>2.</b> A mossy cell action potential was immediately followed by a brief depolarization in a granule cell in <b>20 of 1316 pairs (1.5%)</b> that were recorded in the presence of bicuculline. The mean <i>amplitude</i> of depolarizations was <b>1.990.24</b> (SE) mV when the postsynaptic membrane potential was -55 to -65 mV. Depolarizations could trigger an action potential if the granule cell was depolarized from its resting potential so that its membrane potential was <b>-50 to -60 mV</b>. These data suggest that mossy cells excite granule cells monosynaptically. <br>  <b>3.</b> Monosynaptic excitation of an interneuron by a mossy cell was recorded in <b>4 of 47 (8.5%)</b> simultaneously recorded mossy cells and interneurons, also in the presence of bicuculline. The mean interneuron depolarization was <b>1.640.29 </b> mV when the interneuron membrane potential was approximately <b>-60 mV</b>. When an interneuron was at its resting potential (-52 to -63 mV), action potentials were often triggered by the depolarizations. <br>  <b>4.</b> Without bicuculline present, mossy cells had no apparent monosynaptic effects on granule cells, as has been previously reported.

The contacts formed by the biocytinfilled cell on parvalbuminpositive dendritic targets were investigated using a 100X oilimmersion objective. The number of putative contacts was multiplied by the ratio of the total axon length and the axon length in the selected sections to estimate the total number of synaptic contacts on parvalbuminimmunoreactive dendrites (n=1355 contacts). Electron microscopy of five putative contacts revealed symmetrical synapses between biocytinfilled presynaptic terminals and parvalbuminimmunoreactive postsynaptic dendrites (Fig. 2E, F). Since the axon collaterals were expected to contact several dendrites of the same cell, the dendritic arbors of several parvalbuminimmunoreactive neurons (n=10) were reconstructed from neighbouring sections. These reconstructions indicated that the biocytinfilled interneuron formed from one to seven putative contacts (median, 3) on the dendrites of a single parvalbuminimmunoreactive neuron (Fig. 2D). Typically, these contacts were on different dendrites, but two neighbouring boutons in contact with the same dendrite were also seen occasionally. On the basis of the median number of contacts per neuron and the total number of putative contacts on parvalbuminimmunoreactive dendrites, the filled neuron was estimated to innervate 400450 parvalbumin cells. Similar estimates were not available for granule cells. However, since there were 600010000 boutons in an 80 m section (Fig. 1B), which contains ~8000 granule cells (Seress and Pokorny, 1981; Amaral et al., 199O), it is likely that granule cells are innervated by multiple release sites.

3100393,,,"Number and Location of Putative GCBC Synaptic Contacts<br> The location of synaptic contacts is a main factor that shapes the EPSP time course (Rall 1967). We therefore analyzed the morphological properties of eight synaptically connected GCBC pairs that were filled with biocytin during recording. A photomicrograph and the corresponding camera lucida drawing of a representative GCBC pair are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. In this particular pair, three putative excitatory synaptic contacts were found, established between the hilar collaterals of the GC axon and the basal dendrites of the BC (Figure 3B). In the pairs analyzed, between 2 and 4 putative synaptic contacts were identified (Figure 4B; Table 1). All putative synaptic contacts were established between collaterals of the GC axon and basal dendrites of the BC within the hilar region. The mean axonal length (measured from the GC soma to the putative synaptic contact) was 118 ?m (range, 30241 ?m; Figure 4C), and the mean dendritic length (measured from the BC soma to the putative synaptic contact) was 70 ?m (range, 7147 ?m; Figure 4D). Putative synaptic contacts of the same connection were always formed on different dendritic branches of the BC. The diameters of the presynaptic boutons of the hilar collaterals were relatively small (?1 ?m; Table 1), much smaller than those of mossy fiber boutons established by the GC main axon (Table 1). These results show that the GCBC synapse is a distributed synapse comprised of multiple contacts and that a subset of synaptic contacts is located close to the soma of the postsynaptic BC.<br> In all reconstructed GCBC pairs, the axon of the BC originated at the soma and projected into the granule cell layer; the extensive arborization of the axon was mainly confined to this layer (Figure 3A and Figure 4A). In three of eight pairs, the BC axon formed two or three putative inhibitory synaptic contacts with proximal portions of apical dendrites of the GC (Figure 3A and Figure 3C).

Each type of inhibitory neuron forms between 6-12 synapses with an individual principal cell and each elicits short-latency inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (i.p.s.ps), but with different dynamic characteristics.

Moreover, single presynaptic boutons may establish multiple synaptic release sites, raising the question of whether transmitter release at these sites is independent.

Continuous serial sectioning of the postsynaptic cells for electron microscopy showed that the pyramidal cell postsynaptic to basket cell no. 2 received 119 synaptic contacts on the soma, in addition to the five made by biocytin-filled terminals. Provided that all these synapses were made by similar basket cells, approximately 25 basket cells may converge on a single CA1 pyramidal cell.

The absence of functional information about the basic connectivity of the dentate hilus likely relates to both the absence of dense cell body layers (Amaral, 1978) and the frequent spontaneous synaptic responses hilar cells receive in both in vitro brain slices (Scharfman, 1993; Strowbridge and Schwartzkroin, 1996) and in vivo (Buckmaster et al., 1996). Spontaneous synaptic potentials in hilar neurons greatly increase the difficulty of identifying potential monosynaptic connections in this brain region. Responses to large numbers of precisely timed stimuli are required to verify that apparent postsynaptic responses do not reflect synchronous synaptic input or random coincidences of spontaneous events. The paired recordings in Figure 1B illustrate this problem. Putative evoked EPSPs (responses with onset latencies <3 ms, shown within circles) were greatly outnumbered by spontaneous EPSPs that are not correlated with mossy cell spikes. We used an automated post hoc procedure in this study to identify synaptic potentials in each record (see Materials and Methods) and visual inspection of spike-aligned response averages to circumvent this problem, enabling monosynaptic responses evoked between hilar neurons to be defined for the first time.<br> We tested for synaptic connections among 258 hilar neurons in 35 paired, 44 triple, and 14 quadruple simultaneous intracellular recordings in acute rat hippocampal slices. We recorded postsynaptic responses to presynaptic action potentials evoked by two-pulse stimuli (Fig. 1B2) in 502 potential hilar synaptic connections. Both individual event detection methods and average trace analysis (see Materials and Methods) identified the same 9 excitatory and 22 inhibitory synaptic connections, including the excitatory connection shown in Figure 1C (spike-aligned average response from the same paired recording shown in Fig. 1B2) and the inhibitory connection shown in the average postsynaptic response in Figure 1D. All recordings in this study were performed under current-clamp conditions to enable the intrinsic physiology of both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons to be assessed (see below) and to facilitate testing for multiple synaptic connections between groups of neurons within the same episode using staggered sets of current pulses.",p12214-5,,,,,19020015,Ratios,,3200241.png,
3100400,,,"<b>ESTIMATING THE EXPECTED FREQUENCIES OF POLYSYNAPTIC CIRCUIT MOTIFS.</b><br> We estimated expected motif frequency by first multiplying the probabilities of each connection type, assuming independent connection probabilities, and then summing values from all simultaneous recordings to define the expected incidence of each motif (Song et al., 2005). Expected motif frequency was determined by dividing this number by the total number of each motif type that was possible in all simultaneously recorded groups of neurons. We determined the significance of our reciprocal and divergent circuit motifs using binomial cumulative distribution functions (Song et al., 2005) to determine the probability of finding a value larger than the number of observed motifs. For example, we found four reciprocal connections between mossy cells and hilar interneurons of 114 possible pairings of these two cell types, yielding a mossy cell/hilar interneuron reciprocal motif frequency of 3.5%. The constituent monosynaptic connection frequencies in this motif were 6.1% (7 observed mossy cell-to-interneuron connections of 114 possible) and 14.9% (17 observed interneuron-to-mossy cell connections of 114 possible). Given these monosynaptic connection probabilities, we expected reciprocal mossy cell/interneuron connections to occur with a frequency of 0.92% (1.0 expected in 114 pairings). We conclude that this reciprocal connection motif occurred more frequently than expected with a confidence level of p=0.021 (stated conservatively as p<0.05; binomial p=0.92%, n=114; likelihood of four or more motifs computed using binomial cumulative distribution).<br> We estimated the expected frequency of three- and four-cell motifs using Monte Carlo simulations (Press et al., 1992) to replicate the distributions of hilar cell type constellations recorded simultaneously in each experiment. Monosynaptic connections were assigned based on the connection frequencies (Fig. 4B) (e.g., 14.9% of mossy cell/interneuron simultaneous recordings were connected with an inhibitory synapse). Expected motif probabilities were estimated from the frequency that the motif occurred in 108 simulations using the Mersenne Twister random number generator. The Monte Carlo and binomial methods generated the same estimate of the expected frequency of mossy cell/interneuron reciprocal motifs.",p12214,,,,,19020015,Ratios,,3100398.png,

Neural activity in the neurogenic niche regulates neurogenesis via secreted factors, including direct depolarization of newborn cells by the transmitter GABA. To identify the source of GABA mediating synaptic depolarization, we first tested whether stimulation of single interneurons was sufficient to generate synaptic currents in newborn granule cells (NGCs). Using pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-GFP reporter mice to identify NGCs at an early developmental stage when only sparse GABAergic inputs are present, we serially tested interneurons for connectivity with glutamate iontophoresis or loose patch stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 1). In a total of 111 NGCs, we tested 498 potential presynaptic partners and found a success rate of 2.3% (11 of 498 partners). Presynaptic interneurons were located in the molecular layer (n=2) and hilus (n=9; Fig. 1a), suggesting that NGCs receive input from feedforward and feedback circuits. We found that the success rate for mature, non-GFP-expressing granule cells was tenfold higher (8 of 40 partners). Unitary postsynaptic currents (uPSCs) were recorded in glutamate receptor antagonists and had latencies consistent with those of monosynaptic connections (Supplementary Fig. 2).",p1407,,,,,21983681,DG:H Interneuron?POMC+ Newborn GCs,,3200281.png;3200284.png;3200285.png,

3100418,,,"<b>Macroconnectivity in the CA3 network.</b><br>Our results suggested that connectivity in the CA3 cell network was sparse, with a mean connection probability of 0.92%. Both experimental data and simulations using fully reconstructed CA3 neurons labeled in vivo indicated that connectivity was only moderately dependent on slice orientation (materials and methods; fig. S3). However, connectivity may decline with distance (17). Furthermore, connectivity might be nonrandom, with ensembles of highly connected cells embedded in a sparsely connected population (18, 19). To test these hypotheses, we first examined whether the connection probability was dependent on intersomatic distance (Fig. 2A). The average connection probability did not significantly change with distance, for intersomatic distances of up to 400 m (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, both EPSP and EPSC peak amplitudes were not significantly dependent on distance (fig. S4, A and B).<br>Next, we examined whether synaptic connectivity was random. To test this, we counted all disynaptic connectivity motifs (reciprocal connections, convergent triples, divergent triples, and disynaptic chains) in our experimental data set and compared motif numbers to those of a simulated data set assuming random connectivity and a connection probability of 0.92% (i.e., the experimental value; Fig. 2, B and C). All disynaptic connectivity motifs occurred significantly more frequently than expected by chance. The frequency of reciprocal connections, convergent triples, divergent triples, and disynaptic chains was 6.5-, 2.9-, 6.3-, and 3.4fold higher, respectively, than the corresponding chance level (Fig. 2C; P?0.002 in all cases). Furthermore, we found several superconnectivity motifs (7 connections in one octuple, 10 and 3 connections in two septuples, and 3 connections in two quintuples), which were highly unlikely in random networks (Fig. 2D). As connection probability was not significantly dependent on intersomatic distance (Fig. 2A), the overabundance of motifs was not an epiphenomenon of distance dependence. Thus, connectivity in the CA3 cell network was not random, but highly enriched in connectivity motifs (1719), reminiscent of a smallworld network architecture (20). Both connection probability and abundance of motifs were similar in the range of ages tested (fig. S4, C and D). Comparison of properties of connections embedded in disynaptic motifs with those of isolated connections revealed that the EPSC peak amplitude was smaller and the proportion of failures was higher for embedded connections, whereas kinetic parameters were not significantly different (fig.

However, the longitudinal component has been thought to run exclusively in CA3 (refs. 9,26,27,28). To reinvestigate this issue, we visualized axonal projections from a limited population of DGGCs by injecting Credependent tTA lentivirus and adenoassociated virus (AAV9TREArchTGFP) into the dorsal dentate gyrus of a DGGCspecific Cre transgenic mouse (Dock10cre; Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 7).

These results indicate that the longitudinal component of mossy fibers projects exclusively in the septotemporal direction. Analysis of the mossy fiber terminal distribution confirmed that the septotemporal longitudinal component of mossy fibers mostly innervates the CA2 region, although a small fraction of the very distal CA3 region, adjacent to CA2, also received scattered innervations (percent of mossy fiber terminals: CA2=90%, CA3=10%, n=680 mossy fiber terminals from 6 mice, twotailed paired ttest, P<0.05).",p271,,,,,24336151,Dock10+ DG Granule?(PCP4+ CA2 Neuron;CA3 Pyramidal),,,

3100422,,,"<b>Postsynaptic targets</b><br>In the electron microscope, biocytin labeled profiles were readily identified because of their content of an opaque reaction product. Vesiclecontaining boutons established exclusively symmetrical (type 2) synaptic contacts with their respective postsynaptic targets (Fig. 3, Cand F). These were all identified as axon initial segments because of the presence of an electron dense membrane undercoating and/or fascicles of microtubules. However, differences were observed in the fine structural characteristics of the axon initial segments when compared with those obtained from perfusionfixed brains. With increasing in vitro survival time the undercoating tended to diminish and the microtubule fascicles generally separated into individual microtubules. From a total of nine cells 53 synapses were identified as forming axoaxonic synaptic junctions with axon initial segments. None of the tested biocytinfilled boutons made synapses with any other target, i.e., somata or dendrites, even when these were in direct membrane apposition to the bouton. Some axoaxonic cells had rows of boutons in lower stratum radiatum in the CA1 area (Fig. 2A). To establish their postsynaptic targets we serially sectioned one row from the axon shown in Fig. 2 and studied it with electron microscopy. The row of boutons followed an axon initial segment and three of the boutons could be shown to form synaptic junctions with it. Such initial segments probably belong to disoriented axons or they derive from ectopic pyramidal cells located in stratum radiatum. These findings confirm the notion that the output of axoaxonic cells is highly specific, and beyond, that their light microscopic features are sufficiently distinctive to permit their unequivocal identification. Therefore the remainder of eight cells was accepted without being scrutinized in the electron microscope.",p1293,,,,,8035215,CA1 AxoAxonic?CA1 Pyramidal;DG AxoAxonic?DG Granule ,,,

This suggested that these varicosities are indeed presynaptic boutons. To further corroborate this interpretation, their structure was examined at the EM level (n=8 cells; Fig. 10). OLM and SLM varicosities were easily identified by the dark DABreaction product in biocytinfilled (Fig. 10A; n=43) and EGFPDABlabeled varicosities (Fig. 10A2, B1, B2; n=63). In the majority of cases they were characterized by the presence of vesicles of various size, and formed connections with a clearly identifiable synaptic cleft and postsynaptic density (Fig. 10A2, B1, B2). In 91.8% of the varicosities in the OML and 93.2% in SLM an active zone (the structural equivalent for a functional transmitter release site) with the postsynaptic target structure was established (Fig. 10C1, C2) which further supports the functionality of these varicosities. In both layers, the majority of synaptic contacts originated from en passant axons and were established on dendritic shafts (?85%, n=100) of variable size (Fig. 10A1, A2, B2). Alternatively, they were found on spines (Fig. 10B1).

3100432,,,"From a total of 57 successfully recovered and identified stratum oriens horizontal interneurons, four were judged to be axoaxonic cells based on their axonal arborization. This was determined in an initial light microscopic analysis, giving them a chandelier-like appearance (Somogyi, 1977; Somogyi et al., 1985; Buhl et al., 1994) (Fig. 1A,E). Electron microscopic analysis of a random sample of the postsynaptic targets of two of these cells provided unequivocal evidence that this prediction was correct. The following discussion presents a detailed analysis of the properties of these cells. Some of the physiological features are summarized in Table 1.<br><b>Axonal and Dendritic Patterns; Synaptic Targets</b><br> All four cells presented in this report shared the main anatomical feature of a characteristic axonal arbor located primarily in the part of stratum pyramidale adjoining stratum oriens and also in stratum oriens itself (Fig. 1A,E). For two of the cells (cell 240499 and 080299), some boutonbearing axon collaterals also spread into the deep stratum oriens and alveus. Only a few collaterals penetrated the compact layer of stratum pyramidale and stratum radiatum, but when they did, they established radially oriented rows of boutons, the hallmark of axoaxonic cells (Fig. 1A,E). Because of the truncation of axonal trees by the slicing procedure, no attempt was made to count the rows of boutons here. The main axons of horizontal axoaxonic cells originated in the soma in three cases and from a very proximal dendrite in one case.<br>Electron microscopic analysis of a random sample of 10 postsynaptic targets for each of cell 081298 and 080299 showed that they made synapses exclusively on axon initial segments. Even when the identified bouton was in direct membrane apposition to the cell body of a pyramidal cell, it made no synaptic junction with it, but formed a junction with a nearby AIS. The AIS were recognized by their higher electron opacity than that of dendrites in the same material, and, when present, the electrondense membrane undercoating, microtubule fascicles, and a high density of membranous tubules and large vesicles (Fig. 1F). They only received type II synapses both from the recorded axoaxonic cell and from unlabeled boutons, presumably originating in other converging axoaxonic cells (Fig. 1F). These axon initial segments very likely originate in CA1 pyramidal cells, although only three could be followed back to the parent cells within the examined series of sections. The axons did not form appositions with the axon initial segment, soma, or dendrite of the labeled interneurons themselves; therefore, there was no indication of autaptic contacts (Cobb et al., 1997). The axon initial segment of interneurons examined in the rodent hippocampus so far received no synapses, or very few (P. Somogyi, unpublished observation).<br>The soma of all four cells was spindle shaped, elongated parallel with the layers (called the horizontal orientation), with short and long axes of ~10 and 20 m, respectively. Three of the somata were located in stratum oriens about halfway between the stratum pyramidale and the alveus (Fig. 1AC); one was closer to the alveus. The recovery of three of the cells was excellent, and we were able to trace dendrites to their apparent natural ends. One of the cells showed signs of collapse, and the dendrites were filled with HRP reaction product only in patches. Nevertheless, some could be traced up to a 200m distance, and it is unlikely that any major dendrite was missed. Most dendrites emanated from the two poles of the soma and ran parallel with the pyramidal cell layer. Branching occurred mainly at the origin of dendrites and in their most distal parts. The dendrites showing natural ends could be traced for up to ~340 m from the soma, making a total lateral dendritic extent of 400500 m. The dendrites were mostly smooth, with a few filopodial extensions, as is typical in young animals, and with a low density of drumstickshaped spines on two of the cells. Some dendrites emanated from the sides or upper parts of the soma and were truncated by the slicing procedure. We cannot exclude the possibility that some of the truncated dendrites extended into layers outside the stratum oriens, but this was observed only in one of the cells (cell 240499), which had a small dendrite reaching the lower part of stratum radiatum.",p234-5,,,,,15098728,Mo; CA1 Horizontal Axo-Axonic?CA1 Pyramidal,,,
3100433,,,"<b>2.5. Autaptic connectivity of GABAergic interneurons</b><br>In addition to targeting interneurons and pyramidal cells, individual basket and bistratified cells also appeared to form multiple sites of autaptic [90] selfinnervation with their own membrane surface. For each of 18 interneurons, one 6070 m section containing the cell body and the majority of the dendrites was analysed. For 12 of 12 basket cells and six of six bistratified cells tested, light microscopic evaluation revealed boutonladen axon collaterals of the same cell closely apposed to its somata and /or dendrites. In a single section, at least two and up to seven boutons appeared to be apposed to the somatodendritic domain of each cell. Conversely, axoaxonic cells which exclusively innervate the axon initial segment domain of pyramidal cells [13, 14, 52, 83] showed no such autaptic innervation in any of the 12 biocytinfilled cells examined (not shown). In order to confirm the synaptic nature of such sites seen at the light microscopic level in basket and bistratified cells, a single biocytinfilled basket cell (Fig. 10; full reconstruction shown in Fig. 2 of Ref. [12]) was reembedded in resin and the entire perisomatic region was resectioned for electron microscopy. Light microscopic analysis predicted that seven boutons, originating from five axon collaterals which could be continuously traced to the main axon, were closely apposed to the somatodendritic domain of the basket cell. Evaluation of serial ultrathin sections at the electron microscopic level confirmed that five boutons made autaptic junctions (Fig. 11). In one instance (site 3* in Fig. 10), a single bouton formed two active zones on a principal apical dendrite, close to where it originated from the parent basket cell soma (Fig. 11). All autaptic junctions (n=6) were on very proximal apical and basal dendrites.

3100440,,,"<b>Light and electron microscopic classification of RLM interneurons</b><br>Light microscopic examination revealed that those RLM interneurons with extensive dendritic and axonal labelling (n=22) could be incorporated into at least four distinct, nonoverlapping categories. Prominent differences were apparent with regard to the lamination pattern of the axon, innervating circumscribed hippocampal layers and/or showing a highly distinct arborization pattern. In those instances, when the axon appeared to be colaminated with a major glutamatergic hippocampal afferent pathway, such as the perforant pathway, we have followed the terminology originally proposed for dentate gyrus localcircuit neurons (Han et al. 1993), which has found relatively widespread acceptance and has been extended to other hippocampal subfields (for review see Freund &amp; Buzski, 1996).<br><b>(1)</b> The axon of RLM basket cells (n=4) was confined to the somatic region and adjoining parts of strata radiatum and oriens (Fig. 1A).<br><b>(2)</b> The most abundant type of interneuron, the Schaffer collateral/commissural pathwayassociated interneurons (n=10), for reasons of brevity referred to as Schafferassociated interneurons, predominantly innervated stratum radiatum and, to a lesser extent, stratum oriens (Figs 2A and ?and3A).3A).<br><b>(3)</b> The axon of perforant pathassociated interneurons (n=6) was concentrated in stratum lacunosummoleculare of the CA1 area and could also extend into the molecular layer of both dentate gyrus and subiculum (Fig. 5A).<br><b>(4)</b> The remaining class of localcircuit neuron had a very small stellate dendritic tree and an equally compact axonal arbour within strata radiatum and lacunosummoleculare (Figs 6A and ?and7).7). Based on their striking resemblance to a class of previously described neocortical nonprincipal cells (Szentgothai, 1973) we have thus adopted the term neurogliaform interneurons (n=2).<br>Regarding the efferent connectivity of hippocampal interneurons, the laminar distribution of axonal arbours is already a reasonably good predictor for their postsynaptic domain specificity (Gulys et al. 1993; Halasy &amp; Somogyi, 1993). However, light microscopic predictions are nevertheless insufficient to assess adequately the postsynaptic target preference for particular membrane domains which may overlap within a given lamina, such as, for example, somata, dendrites and axon initial segments being codistributed within the pyramidal cell layer. Within the strata radiatum and lacunosummoleculare potential postsynaptic targets include pyramidal dendrites and spines, the somata of occasional pyramidal cells and the entire somatodendritic surface of other interneurons. We therefore studied the postsynaptic target distribution of a representative sample of RLM interneurons (n=14; Table 2), using random electron microscopic sampling of vesiclecontaining axonal boutons (n=231), 164 of which were found to establish a total of 170 synaptic junctions (Fig. 8AK; Table 2). Overall, these data indicate that postsynaptic target profiles are relatively stereotyped within the respective groups (see below), notwithstanding some degree of variability, which may be partially due to the limited sample size (1017 synaptic junctions per cell). Importantly, all cells appeared to favour pyramidal cells as their postsynaptic targets and it is therefore highly probable that none of the cell classes described below overlaps with those categories of RLM interneurons which have been recently shown to target predominantly, if not exclusively, other interneurons (Gulys et al. 1996; Acsdy et al. 1996).",p761,,,,,9503336,CA1 R-LM,,,

There appeared to be some relationship between the distance separating the two cells and the probability of obtaining an inhibitory connection. Pairs within 50100 m of each other yielded probabilities closer to 1 in 2tested pairs (46 : 89 pairs tested), the lowest success rate for close neighbours corresponding to a presynaptic interneuron with an unusually narrow axonal arbour (370 m, 1 : 13).

The presence of a Schaffer collateral (Sch) in the CA1 stratum radiatum was checked by antidromically activating the collateral with a stimulating electrode (STIM). This fiber could then be orthodromically discharged by injecting a current pulse into the CA3 neuron through the CA3 intracellular electrode. CA1 pyramidal cells were then impaled in the CA1 stratum pyramidale.,Fig. 1,,,,,2319304,CA3 Pyramidal?CA1 Pyramidal,,3100468.png,

The following cell types were identified:<br><b>(i)</b> most abundant were the VIPpositive cells with a hilar projection. Neurons with different dendritic arborization participate in the formation of the hilar axon plexus: (a) cells with ascending dendrites spanning all layers; (b) cells with dendrites restricted to the stratum moleculare; and (c) cells with dendrites restricted to the hilarCA3c region. All these types are immunoreactive for CR, but do not contain CCK. Their major postsynaptic targets are nonprincipal cells of the hilus visualized by SPR immunocytochemistry.<br><b>(ii)</b> Basket cells were located predominantly in the stratum moleculare. They always contain CCK, but never CR. Their axon terminals form symmetrical synapses largely on granule cells.<br><b>(iii)</b> Cells projecting to the stratum moleculare contained CR in 75% of the cases, but never CCK. Typical postsynaptic elements of these cells, among others, are VIP- and SPRpositive neurons.

3100471,,,"The present study of VIPimmunoreactive interneurons revealed a new component in hippocampal networks, GABAergic interneurons, which are specialized to control other interneurons. They should be considered as a third component, in addition to principal cells and other GABAergic interneurons, since the predominant targets of all interneurons described earlier in any cortical areas were principal cells.<br>The postsynaptic targets of three distinct, VIPcontaining interneuron types were established. Two of them were shown to selectively innervate other GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus, whereas the third contacted pyramidal cell bodies and proximal dendrites. VIPpositive cells, projecting to the O/A border, innervated the horizontal dendrites of mGluRlaimmunoreactive (somatostatin and calbindincontaining) interneurons, which are known to be responsible for dendritic inhibition of pyramidal cells. VIPcontaining cells projecting to stratum radiatum also innervated GABAergic interneurons selectively, in particular those which contain calbindin D28k, SPR, VIP and occasionally parvalbumin.",p331,,,,,8783252,selectively target other GABAergic neurons,,,
3100472,,,"Spinefree calretininimmunoreactive (CRIR) interneurons form a subpopulation of GABAergic cells in the rat hippocampus. A characteristic feature of these cells--located in all areas and layers--is the frequent dendrodendritic and axodendritic contacts they form with each other. In this study we examined in detail the connectivity of these neurons by reconstructing their dendritic and axonal arbor and by identifying their postsynaptic targets. Radially running dendrites of CRIR cells, located in different layers, intermingled into long braids. An average cell was in contact with dendrites of three to seven other CRIR cells. Reconstruction of the dendritic trees from six consecutive sections demonstrated that at least 15 cells may participate in a dendrodendritically connected cluster. Electron microscopical examination revealed that regularly spaced zonula adherentia connect the touching dendrites. The postsynaptic targets of CRIR neurons have been examined using postembedding immunogold staining for GABA. CRcontaining GABAimmunoreactive axons of local origin formed multiple symmetrical synaptic contacts (two to five) exclusively on GABAergic dendrites (CRnegative as well as CRpositive). Two to 10 CRIR axons may converge onto a single CRIR neuron, often from cells belonging to the same dendrodendritically connected cluster. Using double immunocytochemistry, CRIR cells were shown to heavily innervate calbindin D28kcontaining interneurons and VIPcontaining basket cells but avoided the parvalbumincontaining basket and axoaxonic cells. The unique connectivity of CRIR cells may enable them to play a crucial role in the generation of synchronous, rhythmic hippocampal activity by controlling other interneurons terminating on different dendritic and somatic compartments of principal cells.",Abstract,,,,,8627375,exclusively on GABAergic dendrites; avoid PV+ basket and axo-axonic cells,,,
