Numerous cells are also present in stratum granulosum, where they are concentrated near the hilar border (Valtschanoff et al., 1993). Cells in the deep hilus have generally large cell bodies and bitufted or multipolar dendritic trees, which are moderately spiny, and rarely enter the granule cell layer. Large hilar cells at the border of the granule cell layer display the typical morphological features of basket cells known from Golgi and immunocytochemical studies (CCK [cholecystokinin], PV [parvalbumin]). They have prominent apical dendrites crossing stratum moleculare and several basal dendrites in the hilus. Cells in stratum granulosum have smaller, fusiform, or pyramidal-shaped somata and a radially running apical dendrite, which forms a tuft that often reaches the fissure or the pial surface. Basal dendrites also emerge from the soma and run in the subgranular polymorph zone, emitting only a small number of branches. Multipolar or radially oriented bitufted cells are also present in stratum moleculare. Dendrites of the multipolar and radial bitufted cells are varicose and spine free.

One section containing many dendrites of the labeled cell was reacted for mGluR1a [metabotropic glutamate receptor 1a] and calbindin, and the dendrites were immunonegative (data not shown).  In another section, the dendrites were shown to be immunopositive for M2 [muscarinic type 2] receptor and sparsely contacted by mGluR7a-positive puncta (Fig. 7D,E), which probably represent immunopositive nerve terminals innervating the dendrite.  After the immunoreactions, all of the sections were processed for visualization of neurobiotin by HRP reaction, and the cell was reconstructed.  The soma was located in the stratum oriens/alveus, and all of the dendrites remained in this layer including the white matter, oriented parallel with the layers (Fig. 8a).  The dendritic field covered 930 mmediolaterally and 1500 manteroposteriorly in the CA1 area and is among the largest fields in our sample of cells (Fig. 8j).  The dendrites were irregularly and sparsely spiny, with most of the spines of the drumstick-shaped variety (Fig. 8c).  In the CA1 area and subiculum, the axon spanned > 3.3 mm in the rostrocaudal direction.  The axon was most dense at the level of the dendritic field and most widespread in the stratum oriens passing into the stratum pyramidale.  In the vicinity of the cell, several major axon collaterals reached the border of the stratum radiatum and lacunosum moleculare, where they turned back and returned to the stratum oriens.  Bouton-bearing collaterals were present in all innervated layers and densest in the stratum oriens (Fig. 8d,e).

The mirror technique of  Kosaka et al. (1985) was applied to hippocampal sections from three colchicine-treated animals. A  total of 60, 62, 77 and 75 CGRP-positive neurons with somata cut in half  on the surface of  the sections were identified,  and their corresponding  other  soma-halves  located  in the adjacent sections  immunostained  for  PV [parvalbumin],  CR [calretinin], CCK [cholecystokinin], or SOM [somatostatin] respectively. None of  the examined CGRP-containing neurons was immunoreactive for any calcium binding proteins or neuropeptides (Fig. 8).  In a recent study (Leranth et al., 1996) GluR2/3 [glutamate receptor 2/3] immunoreactivity was  shown to be absent from interneurons in the dentate gyrus, but present in numerous hilar cells, which were suggested to correspond to mossy cells.  In order to test this hypothesis, and also to have a positive finding in our colocalization study, we examined the coexistence of CGRP and GluR2/3 using the same protocol as above (Fig. 9).

These cells were later given the name ""mossy cells"" by Amaral (1978) due to the ""mossy"" appearance of their large spines (see Fig. 1A).  It has also been demonstrated that all MCs [dentate gyrus mossy cells] selectively stain for GluR[AMPA glutamate receptors]2/3 receptors as opposed to other cells of the hilus (Petralia and Wenthold, 1992; Leranth et al., 1996; Fujise and Kosaka, 1999).  Interestingly, there appears to be differences in the peptide content of the mouse and hamster MC population, with ventral MCs containing calretinin (Murakawa and Kosaka, 2001) which is largely absent in MCs of the dorsal hilus. This is in contrast to the rat where no MCs contain calretinin.

Under each drawing is shown the molecular profile obtained from single-cell PCR analysis for the recorded cell with filled boxes indicating transcripts detected. Also shown are the electrophysiological responses of the cells to the indicated square wave current pulses (bottom) from a resting potential near 60 mV. Depolarizing current pulses and corresponding responses are for near-threshold and 2 threshold stimulation (scale bars shown in K are for all traces). Phase plots of the APs arising from 2 threshold stimulation are shown at right, with the first AP phase plot colored red and subsequent APs progressing from warm to cool colors ending in violet.

Reconstruction of type I interneurons revealed their horizontally oriented dendritic tree in stratum oriens and their axonal arborizations in stratum lacunosum-moleculare (n= 5) (Fig. 2A), and in situ hybridization for somatostatin showed that four of four cells were indeed positive for somatostatin (Fig. 2B).

AnK, ,161202,,,"""The distribution of mGluR1 [metabotropic glutamate receptor 1] and mGluR5 in the subtypes of interneurons, as assessed by single-cell RT-PCR (Fig. 5C), corroborates and extends previous observations. Thus, large horizontal O-LM [oriens-lacunosum moleculare] cells (type I) had been shown to express high levels of mGluR1 protein (Baude et al., 1993). In another in situ hybridization study, mGluR1 expression was found in somatostatin-positive (here type I) but not in parvalbumin-positive (here type III) interneurons, whereas mGluR5 expression was detected both in somatostatin- and parvalbumin-positive interneurons (Kerner et al., 1997). However, the coexpression of mGluR1 and mGluR5 at the single-cell level has not been analyzed so far. The RT-PCR [reverse transcription-PCR] data reveals a complex picture, yet a distinct expression profile is apparent for each of the four interneuron subtypes; the majority of type I and type IV interneurons coexpress mGluR1 and mGluR5.

Previousstudies suggested that CA2 pyramidal cells do not receive mossy fiber inputs from the dentate granule cells because they do not have thorny excrescences, implying that the CA2/CA3 border is located at the point of mossy fiber termination. Because mossy fibers contain Zn2+ at high concentration (Frederickson et al., 2000), Timm staining method may define the border. The technique used in this study has been modified from Sirvanci et al. (2003). Because zinc must be fixed immediately after brain perfusion to avoid washout, electrophysiological recordings cannot be combined with Timm staining. Adult male Wistar rats (120-140 g) were perfused with mACSF, the brain was removed, and a 2500 [microm]m coronal slice containing the entire hippocampus was cut (Vibroslice).""","p7331, left bottom",,,,,,,"Mercer A, Trigg HL, and Thomson AM",Characterization of neurons in the CA2 subfield of the adult rat hippocampus,J Neurosci,2007,17611285,0,,,,,,,,

Although  some  axo-axonic  cells  were  not  tested  to  PV+,  we  use terminology _PV+ cellÓ for all axo-axonic cells because this hippocampal cell type consistently expresses  PV  (Maccaferri  et  al.  2000,  Klausberger  et  al.  2003,  Baude  et  al.,  2007). Furthermore,  CA1  bistratified  cells  systematically  express  PV,  although  some  bistratified  cells were not found positive here. These cells were recognized as bistratified cells by their axonal and  dendritic  patterns  together  with  immunopositivity  for  expression  markers  characteristic  of this cell type, such as somatostatin and/or NPY (Klausberger et al. 2004).""
