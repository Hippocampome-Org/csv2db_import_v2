The cell was reconstructed with light microscopy from 5 X 60-[micro]m-thick sections. The cell body that was located in the pyramidal cell layer (between ---) gave rise to several dendrites that traversed stratum radiatum (srad) and formed a characteristic apical tuft in the stratum lacunosum moleculare (slm). A skirt of basal dendrites coursed through the stratum oriens (so), with their tips protruding into the alveus. The axon, which was only partially filled, formed a dense band of terminal branches in the lower half of and subjacent to the pyramidal cell layer. Properties of this cell are also shown in Figs. 4A, 6A, 10A, and 11, A, C, and D.
