The cells from Mercer 2007, formerly 2332 basket cells, have been reinterpreted so proximal SO and SR are considered to be extensions of SP.
<p>
Mercer (2007): distal portions of horizontal dendrites are sparsely spiny.
<p>
Mercer (2012): dendrites putatively contact pyramidal somata or proximal dendrites.
<p>
Borderline: D:CA3:SP and D:CA1:SP.
