This class has been reinterpreted with multiple layers CA3:SR_SL_SP_SO enclosed by the hilus, which are not delineated by the authors.  The ordering from top to bottom is unknown.

If CA3c is ever separated out as a separate parcel, this class will be affected.

Directed to H치jos paper by Freund and Buzs치ki, who tried to draw parallels between IS-3 neurons in CA1, CA3, and DG, and, therefore, declared dendrites in all layers and axons only in the hilus (typo in F&B Table 2 - "IS-2" should be "IS-3").  Since this interpretation is counter to the single figure from H치jos, Freund and Buzs치ki citations have been omitted from this cell type.

A citation search yielded no further information.

A neuron that had been previously interpreted as CA3 (-)03000 stratum radiatum has now been absorbed into this class.

N = 3.

13 out of 166 VIP+ cells (8%) split across this cell type and DG (-)0003.

Formed a small number of en passant or drumstick-like boutons.

Axons difficult to follow once in DG:H.

Non-principal cell specific targeting with multiple contacts on somata and dendrites.
