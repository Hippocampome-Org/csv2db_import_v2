This class is composed of an amalgam of author-defined classes.

Failed unofficial merger proposals with MEC 331111 stellate II, EC 231000 FOMP, and EC 221100 oblique pyramidal-stellate II.

Sparsely spiny to spiny, projecting -> excitatory.

The figure of the between pyramidal and stellate cell depicts an axon that dies off in L:VI, which is not substantial enough for an A:VI interpretation. - DWW

C&W's LEC description of a pyramidal cell matches 331000.  They also describe a second class (333000) that is n=2 (by itself an insufficient percentage to establish a separate class).  However, since the 333000 class does exist, this evidence is included in that cell type.

The Canto MEC pyramidal neuron from Figure 5 was added, even though it has borderline dendrites in VI.
