Axo-axonic cells exclusively target pyramidal cells while basket cells are also known to target other interneurons.
<p>
Other classes of CA1 basket cells:
- basket 0012 cells are in the 0012 PTI cell type
- basket 2113 neurons mentioned by Fuentealba (2010) are n=1
- basket PV wide-arbour neurons mentioned by Pawelzik (2002) are considered ivy-like cells and are included in the 0333 celltype
- basket 0232 neurons mentioned by Freund & Buzsaki (1996) likely also have dendritic invasion in SLM (evidence based on Pawelzik (2002), meaning they are really basket 2232
