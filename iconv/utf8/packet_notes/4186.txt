                        Since the parcels are not well defined for SUB in these figures, are you just assuming that all of the axon resides in SUB SP? For the reconstruction in Francavilla et al., 2018, it looks like some of the axon may be residing in SMâ¦ - JDK 11/17/2021

                                        It is a very hard call as to where Sub:SP ends and Sub:SM begins. We also have to judge whether the amount of axonal presence in the hypothetical Sub:SM is greater than 15%. - DWW 11/17/2021

                                        Thank you for the van Strien parcel figure to help clarify boundaries between layers. What makes matters more difficult is that there isn't a text description that we can rely on that states layer specific axonal presence within SUB, just that the axons had reached SUB. With that said, I'm open to just assuming that the axon resides entirely within SP. - JDK 11/18/2021

                                        Reviewing my response, I don't think I made it clear my preference. Thinking about this more, I am in agreement with the assumption that the axon resides entirely within SP based off the evidence we have. Therefore, I approve of the evidence as provided in this packet and support the inclusion of this neuron type for v2.0. - JDK 11/23/2021
