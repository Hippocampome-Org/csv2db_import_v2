Claiborne (1986), in the Figure 16 caption, clearly states that contact is made with both the apical and basal dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons, which substantiates the A:CA3:SP interpretation.
<p> 
Small collaterals can extend into SG and SMi.  A:SG are more dorsal than ventral and only contact through en passant boutons.
<p>
Buckmaster (1999) and Blasco-Ib&#225;&#241;ez (2000): evidence for some A:SMi, in particular at the temporal pole of the hippocampus.
<p>
Claiborne (1986): axons pass through CA3c SR.
<p>
Blaabjerg (2007): the most temporal levels in rat have A:CA1; BALB/cJ mice have only an intrapyramidal bundle; SM/J mice have only an infrapyramidal bundle; septally there are almost equal infrapyramidal and suprapyramidal projections with minor intrapyramidal projections; transitioning more temporally the infra- and intrapyramidal projections go away; and infrapyramidal is interpreted as an extended part of SP.
<p>
Axons form asymmetric synapses.  Mossy boutons contact DG mossy cells and CA3 pyramidal neurons.  Fine filopodial processes contact GABAergic and peptidergic interneurons in DG:H and CA3.  A:DG:SG contact dendrites and somata of non-GCs, and A:DG:H & A:CA3 contact somata, dendrites, and spines of GABAergic interneurons.
<p>
Claiborne (1990): 63% of dendritic branch points and 30% of the length in SMi_SG.  37% of branch points and 70% of the length in SMo.
<p>
Desmond (1982): most 1st-order D's in SG and lengths depend on depth of somata in SG; mostly 2nd-, 3rd-, 4th-order dendrites in SMi; mostly 3rd-, 4th-, 5th-order dendrites in SMo; most dendritic branching occurs in SG and SMi; and most dendritic segments located in and terminate in distal SM.
<p>
Dendrites are spiny.  
<p>
D:SG within 100 [microm of the soma are considered to be part of the soma.
<p>
In Geiger (1997) and L&#252;bke (1998) the youngest rats may be adolescents.
<p>
Hosseini-Sharifabad and Nyengaard (2007): 0.24-2.17 million GC's depending on species.
