On page 20, Claiborne (1986), in the Figure 16 caption, clearly states that contact is made with both the apical and basal dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons, which substantiates the A:CA3:SP interpretation.
 
Small collaterals can extend into SG and SMi.  A:SG are more dorsal than ventral and only contact through en passant boutons.

Buckmaster (1999) and Blasco-Ibáñez (2000): evidence for some A:SMi, in particular at the temporal pole of the hippocampus.

Claiborne (1986): axons pass through CA3c SR.

Blaabjerg (2007): the most temporal levels in rat have A:CA1; European hedgehogs have A:CA1:SL; BALB/cJ mice have only an intrapyramidal bundle; SM/J mice have only an infrapyramidal bundle; septally there are almost equal infrapyramidal and suprapyramidal projections with minor intrapyramidal projections; transitioning more temporally the infra- and intrapyramidal projections go away; and infrapyramidal is interpreted as an extended part of SP.

Axons form asymmetric synapses.  Mossy boutons contact DG mossy cells and CA3 pyramidal neurons.  Fine filopodial processes contact GABAergic and peptidergic interneurons in DG:H and CA3.  A:DG:SG contact dendrites and somata of non-GCs, and A:DG:H & A:CA3 contact somata, dendrites, and spines of GABAergic interneurons.

Claiborne (1990): 63% of dendritic branch points and 30% of the length in SMi_SG.  37% of branch points and 70% of the length in SMo.

Desmond (1982): most 1st-order Ds in SG and lengths depend on depth of somata in SG; mostly 2nd-, 3rd-, 4th-order dendrites in SMi; mostly 3rd-, 4th-, 5th-order dendrites in SMo; most dendritic branching occurs in SG and SMi; and most dendritic segments located in and terminate in distal SM.

Dendrites are spiny.  

D:SG within 100 microm of the soma are considered to be part of the soma.

In Geiger (1997) and Lübke (1998) the youngest rats may be adolescents.

Hosseini-Sharifabad and Nyengaard (2007): 0.24-2.17 million GC's depending on species.
