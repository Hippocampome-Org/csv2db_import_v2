This cell type is a merger of CA1 (-)1002 oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) neurons, CA1 (-)1003 oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) neurons, and CA1 (-)1102 oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) w/o back-projection neurons.

CA1 (-)1003 oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) neurons and CA1 (-)1102 oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) w/o back-projection neurons are also being maintained as suspended classes since A:SR and A:SO were very close calls.

Sik (1995) reports that 91.5% of the axon collaterals are in SLM; only 7% are in SO.  According to hippocampome rules, this represents a below-threshold presence.

Axonal presence in SR is variable but consists mostly of continuing branches, with the exception of McBain's (1994) Fig 4A.

Axonal presence in SO is also variable and under threshold.  Unless known connections are reported in the future, this presence will not be counted as per hippocampome rules.

Zemankovics (2010) contains EP data; Losonczy (2002) and Tricoire (2011) contain chemical marker and EP data.
